[{'name': 'API Gateway', 'type': 'Gateway', 'implementation': 'AWS API Gateway provides a secure, managed HTTP endpoint for the GPS ingestion microservice, handling routing, authentication, and traffic management. (REQ-1-400, REQ-1-402)', 'applicability': 'Strictly required to securely expose the internal FastAPI microservice. It acts as the single entry point for GPS data ingestion, offloading concerns like security and throttling from the service itself.'}, {'name': 'Message Queue', 'type': 'Messaging', 'implementation': 'Asynchronous communication using RabbitMQ (Amazon MQ) to pass validated GPS location data from the microservice to the Odoo application. A separate, internal Odoo background job queue is used for GSP call retries. (REQ-1-301, REQ-1-302)', 'applicability': 'Essential for decoupling the high-frequency GPS data ingestion from the core Odoo monolith, which improves system resilience and prevents performance bottlenecks. It also serves as the fault-tolerant fallback mechanism for the GSP integration.'}, {'name': 'Request-Reply', 'type': 'RequestReply', 'implementation': "Synchronous HTTP/REST API call from the Odoo application's business logic layer to the external GST Suvidha Provider (GSP) API.

It isolates problematic messages for manual inspection and reprocessing, ensuring that a single bad message does not halt the entire location-update flow.'}]
