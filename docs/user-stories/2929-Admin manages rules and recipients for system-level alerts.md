# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A new settings view in the Odoo backend, likely under 'Technical' or a new 'TMS Settings' menu.
- A list view showing all configurable system alert types (e.g., 'GSP API Failure', 'High Error Rate').
- A form view for each alert type containing:
-  - An 'Active' boolean toggle/checkbox.
-  - Input fields for alert thresholds (e.g., number field for percentage, duration field for time window).
-  - A Many2many widget to select user recipients (`res.users`).
-  - A Many2many widget to select user group recipients (`res.groups`).
-  - A selection or Many2many widget for delivery channels (e.g., 'Odoo Notification', 'Email').

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Admin can click on an alert type from the list to open its configuration form.
- Admin can enable/disable alerts with a single click.
- Admin can add or remove multiple users and groups from the recipient lists.
- Standard Odoo 'Save' and 'Discard' buttons should be present on the form.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The list view should clearly show the name of the alert and its current status (Enabled/Disabled).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The interface must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, ensuring it is usable with keyboard navigation and screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-SYS-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

An alert rule cannot be saved in an 'Active' state without at least one recipient (either a user or a group).

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

On saving the alert configuration form.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

Prevent the record from being saved and display a validation error to the user.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-SYS-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Notifications for a given alert are only sent to active users. Deactivated users in a recipient list or group are ignored.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

At the time of notification dispatch.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The system should silently skip any deactivated users without raising an error.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the ability to create users who can be assigned as recipients.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-004

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the ability to create user groups/roles that can be assigned as recipients.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-060

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the underlying notification delivery system (Odoo internal & email) to be functional.

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

US-088

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the underlying mechanism for detecting a GSP API failure to exist. This story configures the *reaction* to that detection.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo's base user and group models (`res.users`, `res.groups`).
- Odoo's mail and notification framework (`mail.thread`).
- The external monitoring system (Prometheus/Alertmanager as per REQ-REP-003) which is responsible for detecting the alert conditions.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- A predefined list of system-level alert types that can be configured.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- Integration with the Alertmanager configuration or API to apply the rules defined in the Odoo UI.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- Loading the alert configuration page should take less than 2 seconds.
- Saving a configuration change should complete in under 500ms.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Access to the alert configuration page and its underlying data model MUST be strictly limited to users with the 'Admin' role using Odoo's Access Control Lists (`ir.model.access.csv`).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The interface should be intuitive, allowing an Admin to understand and configure alerts without needing extensive documentation.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The user interface must be fully functional on all supported browsers as defined in the project's overall requirements.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- The primary complexity lies in the integration between the Odoo UI and the backend monitoring system (Alertmanager). A mechanism to sync the rules from the Odoo database to the Alertmanager configuration is required.
- Defining a flexible Odoo model to store various types of thresholds (percentages, counts, time windows) for different alerts.
- Ensuring the notification dispatch logic is robust and correctly resolves recipients from both user and group lists.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The coupling between Odoo and Alertmanager could be fragile. If Alertmanager's configuration format changes, the sync mechanism might break.
- Potential for performance issues if the notification logic is inefficient, especially when sending alerts to large user groups.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Odoo's `res.users` and `res.groups` models for recipient selection.
- The Alertmanager configuration file or API for rule synchronization.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify an Admin can create, read, update, and delete alert configurations.
- Verify a non-Admin user is denied access.
- Simulate an alert trigger (e.g., mock a high error rate) and confirm the notification is sent only to the configured recipients.
- Test with a disabled alert to ensure no notification is sent.
- Test form validation for missing recipients or invalid threshold values.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Test users with 'Admin' and 'Finance Officer' roles.
- A 'Finance Officer' user group with multiple active and at least one inactive user.
- A predefined list of alert types in the system.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for unit and integration tests.
- Odoo's testing framework.
- A mechanism to mock events that would be detected by Alertmanager.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is dependent on the setup of the core monitoring infrastructure (Prometheus/Alertmanager).
