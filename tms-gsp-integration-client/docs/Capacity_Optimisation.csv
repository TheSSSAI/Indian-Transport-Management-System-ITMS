"Cross-training","Siloed expertise in DevOps and Frontend creates single points of failure.","Initiate a formal cross-training program: 1) DevOps to mentor a Backend dev on CI/CD and Kubernetes monitoring. 2) Frontend dev to document OWL patterns and hold a workshop for Backend devs on minor UI fixes.","Reduces key person dependency risk by 40%. Increases team flexibility and bus factor.","80","6 weeks (ongoing)","At least one backend developer can independently debug a CI pipeline failure. At least one backend developer can fix a minor UI bug in an OWL component.","Avoids potential project delays valued at over $50,000 due to resource unavailability."
"Workload Balancing","Uneven utilization across sprints, with bottlenecks in Sprint 1 (DevOps/Backend) and Sprint 2 (Frontend). Sprint 3 has low utilization.","Re-balance the sprint plan. Move one non-dependent, medium-complexity backend story from Sprint 1 to Sprint 3. Move one non-dependent frontend story from Sprint 2 to Sprint 3. This smooths utilization and reduces risk.","Reduces bottleneck risk in Sprints 1 & 2. Improves developer focus and reduces context switching. Creates a more sustainable pace.","4","Immediate (during Sprint 0 planning).","Sprint utilization rates are balanced between 65-80% for all roles across all sprints.","Reduces risk of burnout and timeline slippage, improving delivery predictability."
