## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-014

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system's deployment environment shall be hosted on AWS and orchestrated using containers. The production environment shall be a high-availability Amazon EKS cluster, utilizing Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16 for the database and Amazon S3 for storing all file attachments (e.g., receipts, PODs).

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Confirm the deployment scripts and configuration target an AWS EKS cluster.
- Verify that the application's database connection string points to an Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16 instance.
- Upload a file attachment and confirm it is stored in the designated Amazon S3 bucket, not in the database or on the local filesystem.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- Terraform scripts must define and provision an Amazon EKS cluster for container orchestration.
- Terraform scripts must define and provision an Amazon RDS instance for PostgreSQL version 16.
- Terraform scripts must define and provision an Amazon S3 bucket for file storage with appropriate security policies.
- Terraform must manage the underlying network infrastructure (VPC, subnets, security groups) to support these services.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This is a core requirement that directly specifies the cloud infrastructure to be created and managed by this repository. It defines the 'what' that the Terraform code must build.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-402

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The project shall adhere to the specified technology stack. This includes: ... Redis (via Amazon ElastiCache), RabbitMQ (via Amazon MQ), ... AWS API Gateway, ... Amazon EKS, Terraform for IaC, ... and AWS Secrets Manager for secrets management.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Conduct a code and infrastructure review to confirm that all specified technologies are being used in their designated roles.
- Confirm that infrastructure is defined in Terraform scripts.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The language for this repository must be HCL to use Terraform.
- Terraform scripts must also provision other specified AWS services, including Amazon ElastiCache for Redis, Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ, AWS API Gateway, and AWS Secrets Manager.
- The repository structure should support Terraform best practices, such as using modules for reusable components (e.g., VPC, EKS cluster).

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement explicitly mandates 'Terraform for IaC' as the technology for this repository and lists other AWS services that must be provisioned here, directly defining the repository's technology stack and scope.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-502

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The system must be highly available and recoverable. It shall achieve a minimum uptime of 99.9% during defined business hours... For disaster recovery, the Recovery Point Objective (RPO), representing the maximum acceptable data loss, is 15 minutes. The Recovery Time Objective (RTO)... is 4 hours.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that the database is configured for Point-In-Time-Recovery (PITR) with a granularity that supports a 15-minute RPO.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The Amazon EKS cluster must be deployed across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
- The Amazon RDS instance must be deployed in a Multi-AZ configuration.
- RDS Point-In-Time-Recovery (PITR) must be enabled with a backup retention policy that supports a 15-minute RPO.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This non-functional requirement dictates the high-availability topology of the infrastructure to be defined in this repository's Terraform code, such as using Multi-AZ deployments for critical services.

### 1.2.4.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.4.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-503

#### 1.2.4.2 Requirement Text

The system must enforce strict security for secrets management. All sensitive credentials... shall be stored in AWS Secrets Manager. These secrets must be dynamically injected into the application's runtime environment...

#### 1.2.4.3 Validation Criteria

- Inspect the Kubernetes deployment configuration and verify that it is configured to mount secrets from AWS Secrets Manager into the application pods as environment variables or files.

#### 1.2.4.4 Implementation Implications

- Terraform must provision AWS Secrets Manager secrets to store credentials for services like RDS and RabbitMQ.
- Terraform must configure the necessary IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) on the EKS cluster to allow application pods to securely access these secrets.

#### 1.2.4.5 Extraction Reasoning

This security requirement mandates that the infrastructure provisioned by this repository must include and correctly configure AWS Secrets Manager and the associated IAM permissions for secure credential management.

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Infrastructure & Operations Layer', 'layer_responsibilities': ['Hosting the containerized Odoo and Microservice applications on Amazon EKS.', 'Providing a managed PostgreSQL 16 database via Amazon RDS.', 'Storing file attachments securely on Amazon S3.', 'Managing sensitive credentials and API keys using AWS Secrets Manager.', 'Orchestrating deployment and infrastructure changes via Terraform.'], 'layer_constraints': ['Deployment on on-premise infrastructure or other cloud providers is out of scope.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Infrastructure as Code (IaC)'], 'extraction_reasoning': "This repository is the sole implementation of the 'Infrastructure & Operations Layer'. Its description and purpose directly align with the responsibilities and technology (Terraform) defined for this architectural layer."}

- {'interface_name': 'AWS Cloud Provider API', 'source_repository': 'External (Amazon Web Services)', 'method_contracts': [{'method_name': 'N/A - Declarative Resource Management', 'method_signature': 'Terraform AWS Provider resources (e.g., aws_eks_cluster, aws_db_instance)', 'method_purpose': 'To create, update, and delete cloud resources to match the desired state defined in HCL code.', 'integration_context': 'The Terraform CLI, executed by the CI/CD pipeline, uses this interface to apply infrastructure changes.'}], 'integration_pattern': 'API Abstraction via Terraform Provider', 'communication_protocol': 'HTTPS/REST', 'extraction_reasoning': "This is the primary external dependency. All actions performed by this repository are translated into API calls to AWS, which are managed by the Terraform AWS Provider. The contract is defined by the provider's version and resource schemas."}

The Kubernetes deployment repository (REPO-TMS-K8S) is the primary consumer and is critically dependent on this contract to configure application deployments."}

## 1.7.0.0 Technology Context

### 1.7.1.0 Framework Requirements

The repository must be implemented using Terraform with the HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL). It will utilize the official AWS Terraform Provider to interact with AWS APIs.

### 1.7.2.0 Integration Technologies

- AWS API
- GitHub Actions (for CI/CD of infrastructure changes)
- Terraform Remote State (S3 Backend with DynamoDB locking)

### 1.7.3.0 Performance Constraints

Not applicable at the application level. Infrastructure provisioning time is a consideration, but not a runtime performance constraint.

### 1.7.4.0 Security Requirements

All infrastructure definitions must adhere to the principle of least privilege. IAM roles and security group rules must be as restrictive as possible. Secrets must not be stored in plaintext within the repository; they should be managed via AWS Secrets Manager and referenced by the Terraform configuration.
