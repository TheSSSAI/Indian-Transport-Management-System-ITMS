# This file is intentionally left with only a header.
# The tms_gsp_integration addon extends an existing Odoo model (account.move)
# and does not create new models that require their own top-level access rights.
# Permissions for viewing, creating, and editing invoices are inherited from
# the core 'account' module's security groups (e.g., account.group_account_invoice).
# Specific field-level or action-level security is handled via the view XML and Python code.
