### 3.2.5 When

The trip has 'Approved' expenses totaling â‚¹22,500

### 3.2.6 Then

The 'Profitability' field displays -â‚¹2,500 and the value is visually highlighted (e.g., colored red).

The trip has no expenses or all its expenses are in 'Pending' or 'Rejected' status

### 3.3.6 Then

The 'Total Approved Expenses' field displays â‚¹0.00 and the 'Profitability' field displays â‚¹30,000.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Role-based access control for profitability data

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

A user with the 'Driver' role is logged into the system

### 3.4.5 When

They view the details of their assigned trip

### 3.4.6 Then

The entire profitability section (including Total Revenue, Total Approved Expenses, and Profitability fields) is not visible.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Profitability calculation updates after an expense is approved

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

### 3.5.4 Given

A Dispatch Manager is viewing a trip with a calculated profitability of â‚¹15,000

### 3.5.5 When

The manager approves a new 'Pending' expense of â‚¹1,000 for that same trip

### 3.5.6 Then

The 'Total Approved Expenses' value updates to include the new expense, and the 'Profitability' value is recalculated and displayed as â‚¹14,000 upon view refresh.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Ensure the computed field's dependencies are correctly configured to trigger recalculation when related expense records change.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A dedicated section or group on the Trip Form View labeled 'Profitability Summary'.
- Read-only currency fields for 'Total Revenue', 'Total Approved Expenses', and 'Profitability'.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The profitability fields are for display only and are not editable by the user.
- The values are automatically calculated and updated by the system.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- All values must be formatted as currency with the appropriate symbol (e.g., â‚¹).
- Negative profitability values must be clearly indicated with a minus sign and should be visually distinct (e.g., red text).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Color should not be the only indicator for negative values; a standard minus sign (-) must be used, per WCAG guidelines.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-FNC-007-1

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Profitability is calculated as Total Revenue minus the sum of all 'Approved' trip-related expenses.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

System-wide, on the Trip model's computed field.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

N/A - System calculation.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-FNC-001-1

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Users with the 'Driver' role are not permitted to view trip revenue or profitability data.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Application access control layer (Odoo ir.rule, ir.model.access.csv, and view XML).

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The fields and their values will be hidden from the user interface for unauthorized roles.
