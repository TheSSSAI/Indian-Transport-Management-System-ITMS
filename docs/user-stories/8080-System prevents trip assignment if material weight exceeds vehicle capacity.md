# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A validation error message/pop-up.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The validation should be triggered on the server-side upon attempting to save the trip record.
- For an enhanced user experience, the validation should also trigger via an on-change event in the UI when either the 'Vehicle' or 'Material Weight' field is modified, providing immediate feedback.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The error message must clearly state the conflicting values: the entered material weight and the vehicle's capacity.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Error messages must be associated with the form fields and be accessible to screen readers, following WCAG guidelines.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-007', 'rule_description': "The specified material weight for a trip shall not exceed the assigned vehicle's registered capacity.", 'enforcement_point': 'On creation and update of a Trip record.', 'violation_handling': 'The system transaction (create/update) is blocked, and a user-facing error message is displayed.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The Vehicle Master model, including the 'Capacity' field, must exist to be referenced.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-026

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The Trip Management model and its form view, including 'Material Weight' and 'Vehicle' fields, must exist for the validation to be implemented.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo 18 ORM for model constraints.
- Odoo Web Library (OWL) for client-side on-change validation (optional but recommended for UX).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Vehicle records must have the 'Capacity' field populated with a valid, non-negative numeric value representing tons.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The server-side validation must complete in under 100ms to ensure a responsive user experience when saving the form.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The validation logic MUST be enforced on the server-side (e.g., using Odoo's `@api.constrains`) to prevent circumvention by client-side manipulations.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The error message must be clear, concise, and actionable, guiding the user on how to correct the issue.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA for error identification and suggestion.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The validation must function correctly across all supported browsers for the Odoo 18 web client.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- This is a standard validation that can be implemented with a single Odoo model constraint.
- The logic is a simple numerical comparison.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for inconsistent units if not standardized (e.g., tons vs. kg). The SRS specifies 'Tons' for vehicle capacity, so the trip weight field must use the same unit.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- This logic is self-contained within the TMS Odoo module, specifically between the Trip and Vehicle models.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify successful save when weight < capacity.
- Verify successful save when weight = capacity.
- Verify save failure and correct error message when weight > capacity.
- Verify save failure when assigning an undersized vehicle to a trip with existing weight.
- Verify save failure when a vehicle with zero/null capacity is assigned.
- Verify UI feedback on field change (if on-change handler is implemented).

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- Vehicle records with various capacities (e.g., 10, 15, 20 tons).
- A vehicle record with 0 capacity.
- A vehicle record with null capacity.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for Odoo unit tests.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by team
- Unit tests implemented with >80% coverage for the new logic and passing
- Integration testing completed successfully on a staging environment
- User interface validation and error messaging reviewed and approved by a UX stakeholder
- Performance requirements verified
- Security requirements (server-side enforcement) validated
- Documentation for the business rule is updated if necessary
- Story deployed and verified in staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- Essential for the initial release of the Trip Management feature.
