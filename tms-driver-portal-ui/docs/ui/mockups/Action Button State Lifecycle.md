# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- User
- System/UI

## 3.2 Key Processes

- User Interaction (hover, click)
- Keyboard Navigation (focus)
- System State Change (disable/enable)

## 3.3 Decision Points

- N/A for this diagram type, transitions are event-driven.

## 3.4 Success Paths

- User successfully clicks the button (Default -> Hovering -> Active -> Hovering -> Default)

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- N/A, this diagram describes component states, not user error flows.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Keyboard-only navigation (focus state)
- Programmatic disabling of the button.
