# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clear section or button on the trip details screen labeled 'Mark as Delivered / Upload POD'.
- Choice buttons for 'Upload Photo' and 'Capture Signature'.
- A standard file input that opens the device camera or photo gallery.
- An interactive canvas for capturing an e-signature with a 'Clear' button.
- A mandatory text input field for 'Recipient's Name'.
- A primary 'Submit' button.
- A loading indicator/spinner shown during the upload process.
- Toast/modal notifications for success and error messages.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The user taps to choose between photo and signature.
- If photo, the native device UI for camera/gallery is launched.
- If signature, the user can draw on the canvas with their finger/stylus.
- The system provides immediate client-side validation for required fields upon submission attempt.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- After successful submission, the trip status on the details page should immediately update to 'Delivered'.
- The uploaded POD (as a thumbnail) and the recipient's name should be visible in the trip's history or details after submission.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All buttons and input fields must have proper labels for screen readers (WCAG 2.1 Level AA).
- The interface must have sufficient color contrast.
- All interactive elements must be large enough for easy tapping on a mobile device.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-004', 'rule_description': "The trip status lifecycle must follow the defined path. This action specifically handles the 'In-Transit' -> 'Delivered' transition.", 'enforcement_point': 'Backend controller handling the POD submission.', 'violation_handling': "The system will reject any attempt to set the status to 'Delivered' if the current status is not 'In-Transit'."}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-046

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Driver must be able to log in to access any functionality.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-047

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Driver needs a way to view and select their assigned trip before they can upload a POD for it.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-049

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The trip must be in 'In-Transit' status for the POD upload to be possible, and this story handles the transition to that state.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo's `ir.attachment` model for handling file storage.
- Configured integration with Amazon S3 for persistent file storage (REQ-DEP-001).
- A frontend JavaScript library for e-signature capture (e.g., Signature Pad).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires existing trip records in the database that can be set to 'In-Transit' status for testing.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The UI must provide feedback (e.g., loading spinner) within 1 second of the user pressing 'Submit'.
- The entire upload and status update process should complete within 10 seconds on a stable 4G connection for a 5MB file.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Uploaded POD files must be stored securely in the designated S3 bucket.
- Access to view a POD file must be restricted by Odoo's access control rules to authorized roles (Admin, Dispatch Manager, Finance Officer) and the driver who uploaded it.
- File uploads must be scanned for malware on the server side if company policy requires it.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The entire process from opening the trip to successful submission should require a minimal number of taps and be intuitive for a non-technical user.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must be fully functional on the latest versions of Chrome and Safari on both iOS and Android mobile devices (as per REQ-INT-001).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Integration of a third-party JavaScript library for signature capture within the OWL framework.
- Implementing a robust, atomic transaction on the backend to ensure the file is successfully stored in S3 before the trip status is updated.
- Creating a seamless and responsive mobile-first user experience for file handling and form submission.
- Handling various network conditions and providing clear feedback to the user.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The chosen signature capture library may have compatibility issues with Odoo's OWL framework.
- Poor mobile network conditions in the field could lead to frequent upload failures, requiring robust client-side error handling and state preservation.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- End-to-end flow for e-signature.
- All error conditions listed in the acceptance criteria must be tested.
- Test on physical iOS and Android devices with varying screen sizes.
- Use browser developer tools to simulate slow and offline network conditions.
