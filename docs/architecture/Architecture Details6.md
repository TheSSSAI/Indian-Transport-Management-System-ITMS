# 2 Patterns

## 2.1 Modular Monolith (Odoo Addon)

### 2.1.1 Name

Modular Monolith (Odoo Addon)

### 2.1.2 Description

The core application logic is encapsulated within a custom, installable module (addon) for the Odoo 18 framework. This leverages Odoo's existing architecture (ORM, views, business logic layers) while organizing TMS-specific features into a cohesive but modular unit. (REQ-1-002, REQ-1-013)

### 2.1.3 Benefits

- Rapid development by leveraging a mature framework.
- Simplified deployment and management for core business logic.
- Consistent user experience by adhering to Odoo's UI conventions.
- Built-in support for users, roles, and data persistence.

### 2.1.4 Tradeoffs

- Tightly coupled to the Odoo framework and its versioning.
- Scaling is monolithic; the entire Odoo application must be scaled together.
- Performance of the core application can be impacted by high-volume, non-core tasks.

### 2.1.5 Applicability

#### 2.1.5.1 Scenarios

- Extending an existing ERP system with new, domain-specific functionality.
- Applications where core business logic is complex but transactional volume is manageable.
- Systems where leveraging an existing user and data management framework is a priority.

#### 2.1.5.2 Constraints

- An Odoo 18 Enterprise Edition environment must be available.
- Development must adhere to Odoo's module structure and API.

## 2.2.0.0 Microservice

### 2.2.1.0 Name

Microservice

### 2.2.2.0 Description

A single, decoupled microservice is used specifically for the high-volume task of ingesting real-time GPS location data. This isolates the performance-intensive data polling and processing from the core Odoo application. (REQ-1-013, REQ-1-401, REQ-1-301)

### 2.2.3.0 Benefits

- Isolates high-frequency operations, preventing performance degradation of the core application.
- Allows for independent scaling of the GPS ingestion component based on its specific load.
- Enables use of the best-fit technology (FastAPI) for a specific, focused task.
- Increases overall system resilience; a failure in the microservice does not bring down the entire TMS.

### 2.2.4.0 Tradeoffs

- Increases operational complexity (deployment, monitoring, management of a separate service).
- Introduces network latency and potential points of failure in communication (e.g., message queue).
- Requires data consistency management between the service and the monolith.

### 2.2.5.0 Applicability

#### 2.2.5.1 Scenarios

- Handling high-throughput, real-time data streams.
- Offloading specific, resource-intensive tasks from a primary monolithic application.
- Integrating with third-party APIs that have high polling frequency requirements.

#### 2.2.5.2 Constraints

- Requires a container orchestration platform (EKS) and a message broker (RabbitMQ).

## 2.3.0.0 Event-Driven Integration

### 2.3.1.0 Name

Event-Driven Integration

### 2.3.2.0 Description

Communication from the GPS microservice to the Odoo application is asynchronous, utilizing a RabbitMQ message queue. The microservice publishes location data as events, and Odoo consumes them, decoupling the two components. (REQ-1-301)

### 2.3.3.0 Benefits

- Decouples the producer (microservice) and consumer (Odoo), allowing them to operate and fail independently.
- Improves system scalability and elasticity by buffering requests.
- Enhances resilience through features like dead-letter queues (DLQ) for failed messages.

### 2.3.4.0 Tradeoffs

- Introduces eventual consistency for GPS data.
- Requires management and monitoring of a message broker.
- Adds complexity to debugging and tracing data flow.

### 2.3.5.0 Applicability

#### 2.3.5.1 Scenarios

- Asynchronous data transfer between loosely coupled services.
- Buffering high-volume data writes to a transactional system.
- Implementing background processing tasks.

#### 2.3.5.2 Constraints

- End-to-end latency must be acceptable for the business requirement (e.g., < 10 seconds per REQ-1-501).
