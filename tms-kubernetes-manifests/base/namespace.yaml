# ==============================================================================
# Kubernetes Namespace for the Transport Management System (TMS)
#
# Defines the isolated logical space within the Kubernetes cluster where all
# TMS application components will be deployed. This is a foundational
# resource for providing scope for naming, access control, and network policies.
#
# All subsequent resources (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, Secrets, etc.)
# for the TMS application should be created within this namespace.
#
# As per REPO-TMS-K8S SDS, namespace_strategy.root_namespace is 'tms'.
