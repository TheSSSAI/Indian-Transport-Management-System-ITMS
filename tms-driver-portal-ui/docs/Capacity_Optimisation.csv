"Address Sprint Over-allocation","Sprints 5, 7, and 9 have utilization >100% (113%, 157%, 167%), which is unsustainable and high-risk.","Adopt the 'Staggered Release' timeline scenario. Officially split each over-allocated sprint into two, re-balancing the user stories to keep utilization under 90% per sprint.","Reduces risk of burnout, improves quality, and creates a realistic, predictable delivery schedule.","","Immediate (Planning Phase)","All sprints have a planned capacity utilization below 90%.","Avoids an estimated 4-6 weeks of delay due to rework and burnout, saving >$100,000."
"Mitigate Frontend Bottleneck","A single Frontend Developer is a single point of failure for all mobile UI work.","Allocate 4 hours per sprint for the Full-stack or a Mid-level Odoo developer to cross-train in OWL by pair programming on non-critical UI tasks.","Creates a backup resource for frontend tasks, reducing key-person dependency risk by 50%.","24","6 weeks","A second developer can independently complete a low-complexity OWL task.","Reduces potential project delay by 2-3 weeks if the primary frontend developer becomes unavailable."
"Utilize Underutilized Resources","The FastAPI and DevOps specialists are heavily utilized in specific sprints but have low allocation in others.","Task the FastAPI developer with assisting on the Python-based data migration scripts (US-089). Task the DevOps lead with creating automated performance testing scripts (for RISK-005) during their downtime.","Increases overall team productivity, accelerates high-priority tasks (data migration), and improves quality (performance testing).","","Ongoing","Increased velocity on data migration tasks; creation of a performance test suite.","Improves overall project efficiency and reduces risks without additional cost."
