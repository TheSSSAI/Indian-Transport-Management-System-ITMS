"Cross-training Odoo Frontend (OWL)","Single Frontend Developer is a critical bottleneck (RISK-004).","Allocate 4 hours per sprint for the mid-level Odoo Developer to pair-program with the Frontend Developer on simple OWL components.","Reduces single-point-of-failure risk by 30%. Increases frontend capacity by ~0.2 FTE over 4 sprints.","32","8 weeks","Odoo Developer can independently build and debug simple OWL components by Sprint 6.","Mitigates risk of 2-3 week project delay, valued at >$40,000."
"Automated Testing","High manual testing load on QA Engineer for each new feature.","Allocate 20% of developer capacity in Sprints 2-4 to building a robust E2E test suite using Playwright for critical path workflows (Login, Trip Creation, POD Upload).","Reduces regression testing time by 50% from Sprint 5 onwards. Frees up QA capacity for more exploratory and performance testing.","96","6 weeks","Core workflows are fully covered by E2E tests in the CI/CD pipeline, with a >95% pass rate.","Saves approximately 20 QA hours per sprint, returning value after 5 sprints."
