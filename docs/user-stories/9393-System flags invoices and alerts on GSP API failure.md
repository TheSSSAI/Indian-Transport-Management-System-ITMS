# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

GSP API returns an error response during e-invoice generation

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.1.4 Given

A Finance Officer has initiated the e-invoice generation process for a valid invoice in the 'Completed' state

### 3.1.5 When

The system calls the GSP API and receives a definitive error response (e.g., HTTP 4xx or 5xx status code)

### 3.1.6 Then

The invoice's status is immediately changed to 'E-Invoice Generation Failed'.

### 3.1.7 And

The notification content clearly identifies the failed invoice number (e.g., 'E-invoice generation failed for INV/2024/00123').

### 3.1.8 Validation Notes

Test by mocking the GSP API to return various error codes (e.g., 400, 500, 503). Verify the invoice state change, the logged error message, and the receipt of the notification by a test user with the Finance Officer role.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

GSP API request times out

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

A Finance Officer has initiated the e-invoice generation process

### 3.2.5 When

The system's API call to the GSP does not receive a response within the configured timeout period (e.g., 30 seconds)

### 3.2.6 Then

The API call is terminated, and the event is treated as a failure.

### 3.2.7 And

A high-priority notification is sent to the 'Finance Officer' role.

### 3.2.8 Validation Notes

Test using a tool like 'toxiproxy' or by mocking the API endpoint to introduce a delay longer than the system's timeout configuration. Verify the state change and logged message.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Visual indication of failed invoices in the list view

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.3.4 Given

At least one invoice exists with the status 'E-Invoice Generation Failed'

### 3.3.5 When

A user with appropriate permissions views the main invoice list (tree view)

### 3.3.6 Then

The entire row for each failed invoice is visually highlighted (e.g., using a light red background or a prominent error icon) to distinguish it from other invoices.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Manually set an invoice's state to 'E-Invoice Generation Failed' in a test environment and verify its appearance in the invoice list view.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Notification provides direct access to the failed invoice

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.4.4 Given

A Finance Officer has received a notification about a failed e-invoice generation

### 3.4.5 When

The officer clicks on the notification in the Odoo notification center

### 3.4.6 Then

The system navigates them directly to the form view of the specific invoice that failed.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Trigger a failure, receive the notification, click it, and verify the system redirects to the correct record.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Failure after automated retries are exhausted

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.5.4 Given

The system is configured for asynchronous e-invoice generation with a retry mechanism (e.g., 3 retries with exponential backoff)

### 3.5.5 When

An initial API call fails, and all subsequent automated retry attempts also fail

### 3.5.6 Then

After the final retry fails, the invoice status is set to 'E-Invoice Generation Failed'.

### 3.5.7 And

A single, final high-priority notification is sent to the 'Finance Officer' role, indicating that all automated attempts have been exhausted.

### 3.5.8 Validation Notes

This requires testing the asynchronous job queue. Mock the API to fail consistently and verify that the notification is sent only after the last retry attempt, not on every failure.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A status badge on the invoice form view clearly displaying 'E-Invoice Generation Failed'.
- A visual indicator (e.g., icon, color) in the invoice list view for failed invoices.
- A read-only text field or a log section in the invoice form view to display the last GSP error message.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the in-app notification for a failed invoice should navigate the user to that invoice's form view.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The invoice list view must clearly differentiate failed invoices from others to allow for quick identification and filtering.
- The error message from the GSP must be accessible to the Finance Officer to aid in diagnosing the problem.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Color-based highlighting must be supplemented with an icon or text-based status to be accessible to users with color vision deficiencies.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-INV-01', 'rule_description': "An invoice in the 'E-Invoice Generation Failed' state cannot be sent to the customer or marked as paid until the e-invoicing issue is resolved and the invoice is successfully generated.", 'enforcement_point': "On the invoice form, actions like 'Send & Print' or 'Register Payment' should be disabled or trigger a warning if the e-invoice is not yet valid.", 'violation_handling': 'The system prevents the action and displays a user-friendly error message explaining that a valid IRN must be generated first.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-037

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story handles the failure of the e-invoice generation process, which must be defined and implemented first in US-037.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-087

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the technical integration with the GSP API to be in place, as this story defines the error handling within that integration.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-060

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Leverages the system's core notification functionality. The notification system must be operational.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo's asynchronous job queue (`@job`) for handling retries.
- Odoo's notification system (Odoo Discuss/Mail).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires a defined 'Finance Officer' user group/role to target notifications.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- A sandbox or testing environment for the chosen GSP API to simulate and test failure scenarios.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The failure handling logic must not block the user interface. The status update and notification should occur asynchronously if the initial API call is asynchronous.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Error messages logged from the GSP API must be sanitized before being displayed in the UI to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- Sensitive information such as API keys or authentication tokens must never be included in the error messages logged to the invoice record.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The error message displayed to the Finance Officer should be as clear as possible to help them diagnose the issue (e.g., 'Invalid GSTIN' vs. a generic 'Error 400').

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards must be met for all new UI elements.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The UI changes must render correctly on all supported browsers as defined in the project scope.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires modification of the `account.move` model to add a new state and a field for error logging.
- Involves implementing robust error handling for an external API, including timeouts and various HTTP status codes.
- Integration with Odoo's asynchronous job queue for the retry mechanism adds complexity.
- Requires careful targeting of notifications to a specific user role.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The GSP API may have poorly documented error responses, requiring exploratory testing to handle all cases.
- Misconfiguration of the async queue could lead to jobs being dropped or retried indefinitely.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- External: GST Suvidha Provider (GSP) API.
- Internal: Odoo `account.move` model, Odoo `mail.activity` or `mail.message` for notifications, Odoo's job queue.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Simulate GSP returning HTTP 400, 401, 404, 500, 503.
- Simulate GSP API timeout.
- Simulate GSP returning a 200 OK with a malformed JSON body.
- Verify notification is received by a user with the Finance Officer role but not by other roles.
- Verify clicking the notification navigates to the correct invoice.
- Verify the visual highlighting in the invoice list view.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- An invoice in a 'Completed' state ready for e-invoicing.
- At least two user accounts: one with the 'Finance Officer' role and one without.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for unit tests.
