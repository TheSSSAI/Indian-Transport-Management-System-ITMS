"TEST-FNC-001","Trip Lifecycle Management","Functional","End-to-End","Critical","true","High","Verify the complete trip lifecycle from 'Planned' to 'Paid', ensuring all state transitions, validations, and role-based actions function correctly.","High - Failure in the core business workflow impacts all operations and revenue.","High","Admin, Dispatch Manager, Driver, and Finance Officer users exist. Vehicle, Customer, Route master data is populated. GSP and GPS APIs are mocked.","1. As Dispatch Manager, create a trip (REQ-1-102). 2. Assign an available vehicle/driver, verify status changes to 'Assigned' (REQ-1-004). 3. As Driver, start the trip, verify status changes to 'In-Transit' (REQ-1-113). 4. As Driver, submit an expense (REQ-1-107). 5. As Manager, approve the expense (REQ-1-108). 6. As Driver, upload POD, verify status changes to 'Delivered' (REQ-1-114). 7. As Manager, mark trip 'Completed'. 8. As Finance Officer, generate invoice (REQ-1-005). 9. As Finance Officer, register payment, verify trip status changes to 'Paid'.","The trip successfully transitions through all states ('Planned' -> 'Assigned' -> 'In-Transit' -> 'Delivered' -> 'Completed' -> 'Invoiced' -> 'Paid'). All role-based actions are successful.

All state transitions are correctly logged in the audit trail (REQ-1-207).","Critical - Core functionality is broken.","Every release, nightly CI run.","High - Requires orchestrated data setup across multiple models.","Archive test trip, invoice, and payment records.","Verify that actions at each step can only be performed by the specified role.","Each state transition UI feedback within 2 seconds.","All UI components must be keyboard accessible."
"TEST-SEC-001","Security & Access Control","Security","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify Driver Data Segregation (REQ-1-100): A driver must only be able to view their own assigned trips and cannot access company-level financial data.","Critical - Data leak of sensitive financial or operational information. Violation of principle of least privilege.","Medium","Two drivers (Driver A, Driver B) exist. Trip A is assigned to Driver A. Trip B is assigned to Driver B. Trip A has financial data (rate, revenue).","1. Authenticate as Driver A via API. 2. Attempt to fetch Trip B's data via its ID. 3. Attempt to fetch the list of all trips. 4. Fetch data for the assigned Trip A. 5. Log in to the UI as Driver A and navigate to the trip list page. 6. View the Trip A detail page.","Step 2: API returns 403 Forbidden/Access Denied. Step 3: API returns a list containing only Trip A. Step 4: API returns Trip A data, but financial fields (revenue, rate, profitability) are not present in the response. Step 5: UI displays only Trip A. Step 6: UI for Trip A does not display any financial fields.","Two distinct driver users, two trips assigned to them respectively.","Pytest, Odoo Test Framework, Postman","6","10","4","RBAC (REQ-1-008), Trip Model, User Authentication.","Integration environment.","All unauthorized access attempts are blocked. No financial data is leaked to the Driver role at either the API or UI level.","Critical - Major security vulnerability and data privacy breach.","Every release.","Medium","Delete test trips and users.","This is a core security test case.

"TEST-INT-001","E-Invoicing","Functional","Integration","High","true","High","Verify the GSP e-invoice generation resilience mechanism (REQ-1-302): The system correctly falls back to an asynchronous background job upon a synchronous API timeout.","High - Failure to generate e-invoices blocks revenue collection and violates GST compliance.","High","A completed trip exists. A mock GSP server is running and configured to simulate a timeout. RabbitMQ is running.","1. As Finance Officer, generate an invoice for the completed trip. 2. Trigger the 'Generate E-Invoice' action. 3. Mock GSP server receives the request but does not respond, forcing a timeout. 4. Verify the Odoo UI immediately returns a message 'E-invoice queued for background processing'. 5. Check the RabbitMQ queue for a new e-invoicing job. 6. Configure the mock GSP server to respond with a success message. 7. Wait for the Odoo job runner to process the queued job. 8. Verify the invoice record in Odoo is updated with the IRN and its status changes to 'Invoiced'.","The system gracefully handles the API timeout by enqueuing a background job, which eventually succeeds upon retry, ensuring eventual consistency and compliance without blocking the user.","A completed trip, a valid invoice, mock GSP server.","Pytest, Odoo Test Framework, Mockoon (or similar mock server), RabbitMQ admin UI.","8","20","8","Trip Lifecycle, Invoicing Model, RabbitMQ, Odoo Job Queue.","Integration environment with mock GSP and RabbitMQ.","100% of steps pass.

"TEST-PERF-001","GPS Tracking","Performance","System","High","true","Medium","Benchmark the end-to-end GPS data latency (REQ-1-105) to ensure it does not exceed the 60-second NFR.","Medium - High latency negates the value of 'real-time' tracking, impacting operational decision-making.","High","Performance testing environment is provisioned. GPS ingestion microservice and Odoo are deployed. A load generation script is prepared.","1. Start a load generation script that sends simulated GPS location data to the FastAPI microservice endpoint. 2. For each message sent, record the timestamp (T1). 3. The script continuously polls the Odoo database for the updated location of the corresponding vehicle. 4. When the update is detected, record the timestamp (T2). 5. Calculate latency for each message: Latency = T2 - T1. 6. Run the test for 30 minutes. 7. Aggregate results and calculate P95, P99, and average latency.","The P95 latency is less than 60 seconds. The average latency is under 10 seconds (REQ-1-501).
