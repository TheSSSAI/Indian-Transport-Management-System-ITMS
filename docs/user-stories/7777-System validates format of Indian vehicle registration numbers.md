### 3.2.6 Then

The system accepts the value and saves the record successfully.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Input field for 'Truck Number' on the Vehicle form.
- Error message display area adjacent to the input field.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Validation should trigger on field blur (losing focus) for immediate feedback.
- Validation must also trigger on form submission as a final safeguard.
- The form's 'Save' button should be disabled or the save action should be prevented if validation fails.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The error message must be user-friendly and provide an example of a valid format (e.g., 'Invalid format. Example: MH12AB1234').

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The error message should be programmatically associated with the input field using `aria-describedby` for screen reader users.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-002

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

The 'Truck Number' for each vehicle must be unique across all vehicle records. This story validates format; uniqueness is handled by US-071.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Database constraint and model-level validation.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

Display an error message indicating the number is already in use.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-TMS-VEH-01

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The vehicle registration number must conform to the standard format prescribed by the Indian Motor Vehicles Act.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Frontend (UI) and Backend (Odoo model) on create and update operations.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

Prevent record creation/update and display a format validation error to the user.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-006', 'dependency_reason': "This story implements a validation rule on the vehicle creation form. The form and the 'Truck Number' field must exist first."}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo 18 framework
- Odoo Web Library (OWL) for frontend components
- The `tms.vehicle` model must be defined in the Odoo backend.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

*No items available*

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The validation logic (regex) must execute in under 50ms to ensure a responsive user interface without any noticeable lag during data entry.

## 7.2.0 Security

- Input must be sanitized on the backend to prevent any potential injection attacks, even though the format is restrictive.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- Validation feedback should be provided in real-time (on blur) to allow users to correct mistakes immediately.
- The system should be lenient with user input regarding case and separators (spaces/hyphens), normalizing it upon save.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- Compliant with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for form validation feedback.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- Validation must work consistently across all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires implementation of a regular expression for validation.
- Requires both backend validation (e.g., Odoo's `@api.constrains`) for data integrity and frontend validation (in OWL) for user experience.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- The regex might need to be adjusted to accommodate less common or older vehicle number formats if they are required by the business. The initial implementation should cover the most common modern formats.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- This validation will be part of the `tms.vehicle` model and its corresponding form view in Odoo.

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Test with a comprehensive list of valid Indian vehicle numbers from different states and eras.
- Test with a list of common invalid formats (wrong length, special characters, incorrect structure).
- Test the UI flow: enter invalid data, see error, correct data, see error disappear, save successfully.
- Test case-insensitivity and handling of spaces/hyphens.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- Valid examples: 'MH12AB1234', 'KA 05 XY 9999', 'dl-01-c-4321'.
- Invalid examples: 'MH12ABC123', '12MHAB1234', 'MH-12-AB-1234!', '' (empty string).

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for backend unit tests.
- Odoo's built-in tour/JS testing framework for frontend/E2E tests.

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing.
- Backend validation using `@api.constrains` is implemented and covered by unit tests.
- Frontend validation in the OWL component is implemented and provides real-time feedback.
- Code has been peer-reviewed and adheres to project coding standards (Flake8, Black).
- Unit test coverage for the new logic meets the project's 80% threshold.
- End-to-end testing confirms the user flow on the vehicle form.
- The feature is deployed and verified in the staging environment without regressions.

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

1

## 11.2.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational data integrity feature for the Vehicle Master. It should be implemented in the same sprint as or immediately after the creation of the vehicle master form (US-006).

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

- This feature is critical for the initial release of the Vehicle Management module to ensure data quality from the start.
