# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A new menu item under 'Settings' or 'Configuration' named 'Expense Thresholds'.
- A list or table view displaying all available expense categories.
- A numeric input field next to each category name for the threshold amount.
- A 'Save' button to persist all changes on the page.
- User feedback messages (e.g., toast notifications) for success and error states.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Admin can enter and edit numeric values in the threshold fields.
- Clicking 'Save' applies all changes made on the page.
- The page should prevent form submission if any field contains invalid data.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Expense category names should be displayed as read-only labels.
- Input fields should be clearly associated with their respective currency.
- Help text should be present on the page, e.g., 'Set the maximum amount for an expense category that can be approved without Admin-level review. Leave blank for no limit.'

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All form fields must have associated labels for screen readers.
- The page must be navigable using a keyboard.
- Validation error messages must be programmatically associated with the invalid input fields.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-EXP-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

The threshold amount must be a non-negative numeric value.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

On form submission in the 'Expense Threshold Configuration' UI.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

Prevent saving and display a user-friendly validation error message.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-EXP-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A null or empty threshold value for a category means there is no spending limit requiring special review.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

During the expense approval workflow.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

N/A. This is the default behavior.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-004

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The 'Admin' role and its permissions must be defined to enforce access control.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

N/A - Assumed

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

A mechanism to create and manage expense categories (e.g., 'Food', 'Toll') must exist. This story configures those categories.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Depends on the Odoo security framework (ir.model.access.csv) to restrict access to Admins.
- Requires a master data model for expense categories to exist.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- The system must have a populated list of expense categories to configure.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The configuration page must load in under 2 seconds with up to 100 expense categories.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Access to the configuration page and its underlying data model must be strictly limited to users with the 'Admin' role.
- Input must be sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The purpose of the page and the effect of setting a threshold should be immediately clear to the Admin user.
- Saving changes should provide clear and immediate feedback.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all browsers supported by Odoo 18.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- This story focuses only on creating the UI and model to store the threshold values. The complexity is low as it involves standard Odoo view and model creation.
- The logic for *using* these thresholds in the approval workflow will be handled in a separate story, which will have a higher complexity.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The contract between this story and the expense approval story must be clearly defined. The approval workflow needs to know how to query and interpret the values set here (e.g., how to handle a null/blank value).

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- The data model created in this story will be read by the expense approval workflow to determine if an expense requires special review.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify an Admin can create, update, and delete a threshold.
- Verify data validation for non-numeric and negative inputs.
- Verify that a non-Admin user (e.g., Dispatch Manager) receives an access denied error when trying to access the page.
- Verify that a newly created expense category appears on the configuration page.
- An integration test must be written to confirm that the expense approval workflow can correctly read the value set by this feature.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A set of pre-defined expense categories.
- User accounts with 'Admin' and 'Dispatch Manager' roles.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for backend unit and integration tests.
- Odoo's built-in testing framework.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing.
- Code reviewed and approved by at least one other developer.
- Unit tests implemented for the model logic with >80% coverage.
- Security access rules are implemented and tested.
- User interface is responsive and matches the requirements.
- The data model and access method for the approval workflow are documented.
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

2

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸŸ¡ Medium

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is a prerequisite for implementing the 'Admin-level review' logic in the expense approval workflow. It should be planned in a sprint before or concurrently with the related approval story.
- The team needs to agree on the model structure (e.g., a new field on the existing expense category model vs. a separate configuration model) before starting development.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- This feature is a key part of the expense management module, enabling core business policy enforcement.
