# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary responsibility is to poll a third-party GPS provider's API for real-time vehicle location data.
- Secondary responsibility is to validate the ingested data against a strict, predefined contract.
- Tertiary responsibility is to publish the validated location data as a standardized 'VehicleLocationUpdated' event to a RabbitMQ message queue.
- The service is explicitly scoped to be decoupled and isolated from the core Odoo monolith to protect the monolith's performance.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- FastAPI: High-performance asynchronous web framework for the service's core.
- Python 3.11: The underlying programming language, leveraging modern async/await features.
- Docker: The containerization technology for packaging the service as a self-contained, deployable artifact.
- Supporting Tech: Uvicorn (ASGI server), Pydantic (data validation), httpx (async HTTP client), aio-pika (async RabbitMQ client).

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Must be deployed as a separate, containerized microservice on AWS EKS, independent of the Odoo monolith.
- Communication with the Odoo monolith must be asynchronous via a RabbitMQ message broker.
- Must implement robust error handling for external API polling, including an exponential backoff retry mechanism.
- The service must be stateless, with all configuration and secrets managed externally (environment variables and AWS Secrets Manager).

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Microservice

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The repository implements a single, decoupled microservice focused exclusively on GPS data ingestion. This isolates a high-volume, I/O-intensive task from the core monolithic application.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- gps-ingestion-service-002

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

The service will be built as a standalone FastAPI application, packaged in a Docker container, and deployed independently. It will not share a database or runtime with the Odoo monolith.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern was chosen to protect the performance and stability of the core transactional system from the high frequency of GPS polling, and to allow for independent scaling of the ingestion component, as stated in REQ-1-013 and the architecture document.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Event-Driven Integration

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

The service acts as an Event Producer. After processing GPS data, it publishes a 'VehicleLocationUpdated' event to a RabbitMQ message queue, decoupling it from the consumers of this data.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- gps-ingestion-service-002
- RabbitMQ Message Queue

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

An asynchronous AMQP client library will be used to publish messages. The message payload will be a JSON-serialized Pydantic model, serving as a well-defined event schema.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning
