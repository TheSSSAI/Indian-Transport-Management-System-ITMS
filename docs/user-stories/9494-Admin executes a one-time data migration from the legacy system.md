A clean CSV file containing active customers from the legacy system, formatted according to the defined data mapping specification

### 3.1.5 When

The Admin executes the customer migration process

### 3.1.6 Then

All customer records from the file are created in the Odoo 'res.partner' model, all fields (Name, Billing Address, GSTIN, Contact Person) are mapped correctly, and the post-migration validation report shows the number of imported records matches the source file.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify by checking record counts in the Odoo backend and spot-checking at least 10 customer records via the UI to confirm data integrity.

A clean CSV file containing all vehicles (active and inactive) from the legacy system

### 3.2.5 When

The Admin executes the vehicle migration process

### 3.2.6 Then

All vehicle records are created in the TMS Vehicle model, with all fields (Truck Number, Model, Capacity, Owner Details, Status) mapped correctly, and the validation report confirms matching record counts.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify by checking record counts and spot-checking vehicle records, including one 'Inactive' vehicle.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.4 Given

A clean CSV file containing active drivers from the legacy system

### 3.3.5 When

The Admin executes the driver migration process

### 3.3.6 Then

All driver records are created in the Odoo 'hr.employee' model, with driver-specific fields (License Number, License Expiry Date) populated correctly, and the validation report confirms matching record counts.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Verify by checking record counts and spot-checking driver records in the 'Employees' module.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

Successful migration of open financial transactions (unpaid invoices)

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.4.4 Given

The customer migration has been successfully completed, and a clean CSV file of open invoices is available

### 3.4.5 When

The Admin executes the invoice migration process

### 3.4.6 Then

All open invoices are created in Odoo, correctly linked to their respective customer records, and reflect the correct outstanding balance.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Verify by checking the total outstanding balance of migrated invoices against the source system's total. Spot-check several customer ledgers to confirm invoices appear correctly.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Migration script handles records with missing mandatory data

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

A source CSV file where one or more records are missing a mandatory field (e.g., a customer without a name)

### 3.5.5 When

The Admin executes the relevant migration script

### 3.5.6 Then

The script skips the invalid records, logs a detailed error for each skipped record (including row number and reason), and successfully processes all other valid records in the file.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Inspect the migration log file to confirm that specific errors for the invalid rows were logged and that the count of successfully imported records is correct.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Migration process is idempotent and prevents duplicate records

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.6.4 Given

The customer migration process has already been run once successfully

### 3.6.5 When

The Admin re-runs the exact same customer migration process with the same source file

### 3.6.6 Then

No duplicate customer records are created in the system, and the migration log indicates that the records were skipped because they already exist.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Check the total count of customer records before and after the second run. The count should not have changed. The log file should show 'skipped' messages.

### 3.7.4 Given

The entire migration process (for all data scopes) has been completed

### 3.7.5 When

The Admin reviews the output of the process

### 3.7.6 Then

A summary log or report file is generated that clearly states for each data type (Customers, Vehicles, etc.): total records in source, records successfully imported, and records failed/skipped.

### 3.7.7 Validation Notes

Locate and review the summary report file. The numbers should be clear, accurate, and auditable.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

- This is a backend process. No new UI elements are required in the Odoo application itself.
- The primary interface will be a Command Line Interface (CLI) for executing the migration scripts.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Admin will configure the process via a configuration file (e.g., database credentials, file paths).
- Admin will execute a master script from the command line.
- Admin will review text-based log files and summary reports generated by the scripts.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Real-time progress output to the console during script execution.
- A detailed, persistent log file containing timestamps, actions taken, successes, and failures.
- A final summary report with aggregate counts for each migrated entity.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Not applicable, as this is a backend administrative task.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-MIG-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

Migration must be performed in a specific sequence: Customers, then Vehicles and Drivers, and finally Open Invoices, to maintain relational integrity.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

The master orchestration script for the migration process.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The script should halt with an error if a prerequisite data type has not been migrated.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-MIG-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Only 'active' Customers and 'active' Drivers from the legacy system should be migrated, as per REQ-TRN-002.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

The data transformation and cleansing scripts.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

Inactive records should be filtered out and excluded from the final import files.
