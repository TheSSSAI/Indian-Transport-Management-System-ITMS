# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A new menu item 'Audit Trail' under the 'Administration' or 'Settings' menu.
- A standard Odoo list view for displaying log entries.
- Standard Odoo search and filter widgets for User, Date Range, Record Type, etc.
- A detail view (modal or expandable row) to show 'Old Value' and 'New Value' for update operations.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The entire audit trail interface must be read-only. No create, edit, or delete actions are permitted on the logs themselves.
- Users can click on a log entry to view more details about the change.
- Filtering should be intuitive and responsive.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The list view must clearly display: Timestamp, User, Action, Record Type, Record ID/Name.
- The detail view for 'Update' actions must have clear 'Field', 'Old Value', and 'New Value' columns.
- Long text values in the old/new value display should be truncated with an option to view the full text.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The view must be keyboard navigable.
- All filter controls and table headers must be properly labeled for screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

REQ-DAT-008

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

The system must maintain an immutable audit trail for all CRUD operations on critical data models: Trips, Invoices, Payments, and user permissions.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

ORM layer (create, write, unlink methods of the specified models).

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

This is a system requirement, not a user rule. The system must log these events automatically.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-AUDIT-001

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

Audit log entries cannot be modified or deleted by any user, including system administrators.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Model-level security for the audit log model. The `write()` and `unlink()` methods should be overridden to raise an exception.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

Any attempt to modify a log will result in an 'Access Denied' error.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-001

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

User model must exist to log which user performed an action.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-004

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

User permission/role model must exist to be audited.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-026

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Trip model must exist to be audited.

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

US-037

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

Invoice model must exist to be audited.

### 6.1.5.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.5.1 Story Id

US-039

#### 6.1.5.2 Dependency Reason

Payment model must exist to be audited.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Requires a robust, custom data model for storing audit logs, as Odoo's base logging is insufficient for this level of detail.
- Requires overriding core ORM methods (`create`, `write`, `unlink`) on all audited models.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

*No items available*

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The audit trail view, with filters applied, must load in under 3 seconds, even with over 1 million log entries.
- The logging mechanism should add minimal overhead (<50ms) to standard database operations (create, write, unlink) to avoid impacting user experience.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The core requirement is immutability. The audit log table must be protected from direct modification at the database and application layers.
- Access to the audit trail view must be strictly limited to users with the 'Admin' role via Odoo's access control lists (`ir.model.access.csv` and `ir.rule`).

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The audit trail should be easy to search and filter, allowing an Admin to quickly find the information they need.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The system shall strive to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA accessibility standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported modern web browsers.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

High

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Designing a generic, reusable logging mechanism (e.g., a mixin) that can be applied to any model.
- Correctly overriding ORM methods on multiple models without introducing bugs or performance issues.
- Ensuring the immutability of the logs is technically robust.
- Database schema design and indexing for the audit log table to handle high data volume efficiently.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Poorly implemented ORM overrides could lead to performance degradation or infinite recursion.
- The audit log table could grow very large, potentially impacting database performance and backup times if not managed properly (e.g., with partitioning or archiving).

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- This feature will integrate deeply with the Odoo ORM layer for the following models: `tms.trip`, `account.move`, `account.payment`, `res.users`, and `res.groups`.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- Security
- Performance

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify log creation for each CRUD action on every critical model.
- Verify the accuracy of 'old' and 'new' value logging for various field types.
- Perform negative security tests by attempting to alter/delete logs as an Admin.
- Perform load testing on the audit trail view with a large dataset (1M+ records) to check query performance.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A large, pre-populated set of audit log data for performance testing.
- Multiple user accounts with different roles to test that actions are logged against the correct user.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for unit and integration tests.
- A database load generation tool (e.g., pgbench or custom scripts) for performance testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by team
- Unit tests implemented with >80% coverage for the logging logic and passing
- Integration testing completed for all audited models
- Security testing confirms the immutability of the logs
- Performance testing confirms the audit view meets NFRs
- User interface reviewed and approved by the product owner
- Documentation for the audit trail feature is created for the Admin Guide
- Story deployed and verified in the staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational security feature and should be prioritized before features that modify the critical data models are released to production.
- The implementation requires a senior developer due to the complexity of ORM overrides and database performance considerations.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- This feature is critical for a production-ready, secure system and is a prerequisite for go-live.
