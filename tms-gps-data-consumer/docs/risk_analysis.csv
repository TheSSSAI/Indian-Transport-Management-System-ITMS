"RISK-001","External","The third-party GSP API for e-invoicing (REQ-1-006) experiences frequent outages or has high latency, leading to an inability to generate compliant invoices, thereby blocking the revenue cycle and causing compliance failures.","3","5","15","High","WI-025, WI-026, WI-027, US-037, US-038, US-087","Critical business function (invoicing compliance) is dependent on a single external service whose stability is outside the project team's control.","Implement the resilient synchronous/asynchronous fallback pattern using a message queue as specified in REQ-1-302. Procure a GSP with a strong SLA and establish a direct technical support channel. Perform extensive integration testing against the GSP sandbox.","Develop and document a manual intervention workflow (US-038) for Finance Officers to generate IRNs directly from the government portal and update the TMS record during prolonged GSP outages.","Prometheus alert fires when the GSP API error rate exceeds 10% over a 5-minute window, or P95 latency exceeds 5 seconds.","Project Manager / Lead Backend Engineer","2025-05-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The real-time GPS data ingestion pipeline (FastAPI -> RabbitMQ -> Odoo Consumer) fails to meet the end-to-end latency requirement of <60 seconds (REQ-1-105) under load, leading to stale location data and rendering the live tracking feature unreliable.","4","4","16","High","EPIC-005, WI-035, WI-037, WI-057, WI-058, US-029","Complexity of a multi-component, asynchronous data pipeline where bottlenecks can occur in the microservice, message broker, or the Odoo consumer cron job.","Conduct early performance and load testing on the pipeline with simulated data. Optimize the Odoo consumer to process messages in batches and perform bulk database updates. Ensure RabbitMQ and consumer pods are appropriately resourced.","If latency targets are consistently missed, increase the polling frequency of the frontend map view to provide a sense of near-real-time updates, while working on backend optimization. Provide a 'last updated' timestamp on the UI.","Grafana dashboard shows end-to-end message latency (from microservice ingestion to Odoo DB write) exceeding 30 seconds for more than 5% of messages.","Lead DevOps Engineer / Lead Backend Engineer","2025-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","The one-time data migration from the legacy system (REQ-1-801) encounters unexpectedly poor data quality, requiring extensive manual cleansing that exceeds the planned cutover window, delaying the go-live date.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-009, WI-052, WI-053, WI-055, US-089, US-090","Underestimation of data cleansing effort due to incomplete understanding of the legacy system's data integrity issues.","Obtain a full data extract from the legacy system early in the project for analysis. Mandate at least two full, successful dry-runs in the staging environment. Develop comprehensive validation scripts (US-090) to identify issues pre-cutover. Allocate a 50% time buffer in the cutover weekend plan.","Prepare a phased migration strategy, prioritizing essential data (active customers/vehicles) for go-live and scheduling a follow-up migration for less critical historical data. Have a documented rollback plan ready.","The first dry-run script reports a data validation/cleansing failure rate greater than 5% for any master data entity.","Project Manager / Data Engineer","2025-07-01","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","The custom OWL components for the Driver Portal (EPIC-004) suffer from poor performance and usability issues on a wide range of mobile devices and browsers, leading to low driver adoption and inaccurate field data.","3","4","12","Medium","EPIC-004, WI-028 to WI-033, US-046, US-047, US-052","Complexity of developing a responsive, high-performance single-page application experience within the Odoo framework, combined with insufficient real-world device testing.","Conduct early-stage prototyping and usability testing with actual drivers. Automate E2E tests for core workflows on multiple mobile viewports using a framework like Playwright. Adhere strictly to responsive design principles (REQ-1-001) from the outset.","If performance issues persist, simplify complex UI components, replacing them with more traditional, server-rendered pages for critical but slow workflows. Prioritize functionality over complex animations or interactions.","Usability testing sessions reveal a task completion failure rate of over 20% for any core driver workflow. LCP for portal pages exceeds 4 seconds on simulated 4G networks.","Lead Frontend Engineer / QA Lead","2025-06-20","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Operational","Incorrect configuration of the Kubernetes deployment, networking, or IAM roles within the Terraform scripts (EPIC-011) leads to an unstable or insecure production environment, causing frequent downtime or security vulnerabilities post-go-live.","3","5","15","High","EPIC-011, WI-060, WI-061, WI-062, WI-064","High complexity of deploying a hybrid-architecture application on EKS using IaC, with many interconnected components (RDS, S3, MQ, Secrets Manager) that must be configured correctly.","Mandate peer reviews for all Terraform and Kubernetes manifest changes. Provision a staging environment that is an exact replica of production using the same IaC scripts. Conduct automated security scanning of infrastructure configurations and container images.","Maintain version-controlled infrastructure code, enabling quick rollbacks to a last known-good configuration. Prepare a DR runbook for restoring the application in a new environment from backups and IaC.","Pre-deployment security scans (e.g., tfsec, Checkov) report any high-severity misconfigurations. Staging environment deployments fail repeatedly.","Lead DevOps Engineer","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Security","Incorrectly implemented Odoo record rules (`ir.rule`) for data segregation (REQ-1-100) fail to properly isolate driver data, leading to a data leak where one driver can view another driver's trip details or personal information.","2","5","10","Medium","WI-049, US-047, US-057","Complexity of writing performant and logically correct domain filters for Odoo record rules, which can be difficult to test exhaustively.","Implement specific, automated integration tests that create multiple drivers and trips, then log in as each driver to verify that API calls only return their own data. Conduct manual E2E testing for all driver-facing views. Peer review of all security-related XML definitions.","If a data leak is discovered post-deployment, immediately disable access to the Driver Portal for all users except admins. Deploy an emergency patch with a corrected and verified `ir.rule`.","An integration test in the CI/CD pipeline specifically designed to check for data leaks fails.","Lead Odoo Developer / QA Lead","2025-05-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Resource","A key person dependency on a developer with specialized knowledge in both Odoo backend and the AWS/Kubernetes stack creates a single point of failure. Their unexpected absence could severely delay critical integration tasks.","2","4","8","Medium","EPIC-005, EPIC-011, All integration work","Concentration of deep, cross-domain knowledge in a single team member.","Enforce mandatory pair programming sessions for all complex infrastructure and integration tasks. Require thorough documentation and runbooks for all deployment and operational procedures. Cross-train at least one other developer on the CI/CD pipeline and microservice deployment.","Have a pre-approved budget for an external consultant or contractor with the required skillset who can be brought in on short notice if the key person becomes unavailable for an extended period.","Project velocity on infrastructure or integration tasks drops to zero when the key person is on planned leave. Documentation for a new feature is not created within one sprint of its completion.","Project Manager","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Technical","The logic for calculating trip profitability (REQ-1-111) is flawed, either by including non-approved expenses or miscalculating revenue, leading to inaccurate financial reports and poor business decisions.","2","4","8","Medium","WI-022, WI-043, US-035, US-044, US-085","Incorrect Odoo computed field dependencies (`@api.depends`) leading to stale data, or a flawed query in the reporting engine.","Implement extensive unit tests for the profitability calculation logic covering all edge cases (zero expenses, rejected expenses, etc.). Conduct a dedicated QA cycle with the finance team to manually validate report outputs against a known dataset in the staging environment.","If inaccuracies are found post-launch, immediately add a disclaimer to all profitability reports. Develop and deploy a patch with corrected logic. Provide a script for recalculating historical profitability if required.","A unit test for the profitability calculation fails.
