### 3.1.6 Then

The system saves the maintenance schedule, and a notification is immediately sent to all 'Active' users via both the in-app notification system and their registered email address.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

### 3.4.4 Given

A maintenance window has been previously scheduled and announced to all users

### 3.4.5 When

The Admin navigates to the scheduled maintenance record and triggers a 'Cancel' action

### 3.4.6 Then

The system marks the maintenance record as 'Canceled' and immediately sends a new notification to all 'Active' users (in-app and email) stating that the planned maintenance has been canceled.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Verify that a new notification with 'CANCELED' or similar in the subject/title is received by active users.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.4 Given

A maintenance notification has been sent

### 3.5.5 When

A user views the notification in their email client or the in-app system

### 3.5.6 Then

The notification clearly displays the maintenance start time (with timezone), end time (with timezone), and the reason/impact message as entered by the Admin.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Visually inspect the email and in-app notification for clarity, correct data, and professional formatting.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A new menu item under Admin settings for 'Maintenance Notifications'.
- A list/tree view showing scheduled, past, and canceled maintenance.
- A form view for creating/editing a maintenance notification with fields for 'Start DateTime', 'End DateTime', and a rich text 'Message'.
- Buttons for 'Schedule', 'Cancel', and 'Save'.
- In-app notifications to appear in the standard Odoo notification area (bell icon).

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Admin can create, view, and cancel maintenance notifications.
- All users can view received notifications in-app and via email.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- All dates and times must be displayed with the appropriate timezone to avoid confusion.
- The status of the maintenance (e.g., Scheduled, Canceled, Completed) should be clearly visible in the Admin list view.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Email notifications must use semantic HTML for screen reader compatibility.
- The Admin interface must adhere to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, consistent with the rest of the application.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-MAINT-001', 'rule_description': 'Planned maintenance must be announced at least 24 hours before its start time.', 'enforcement_point': 'On save/validation of the maintenance schedule record.', 'violation_handling': 'Prevent record creation and display a user-friendly error message.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-004

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the 'Admin' role to be defined to control access to this feature.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-060

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the foundational notification system (both in-app and email channels) to be functional for delivering the alerts.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- A configured and operational SMTP service for sending emails from Odoo.
- Odoo's internal messaging and notification framework (`mail` module).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- A list of all 'Active' users and their associated, valid email addresses.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- Sending notifications to all users must be handled by an asynchronous background job to prevent UI blocking for the Admin, completing within 5 minutes for up to 1000 users.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Only users with the 'Admin' role can create, schedule, or cancel maintenance notifications.
- The rich text message input must be sanitized to prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process for an Admin to schedule a notification should be intuitive and require minimal steps.
- The notification message received by users must be unambiguous and easy to understand.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Email notifications must render correctly in major modern email clients (e.g., Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires a new Odoo model and associated views (form, tree).
- Involves custom business logic for validation (24-hour rule).
- Requires integration with Odoo's mail queue system for robust, asynchronous sending of both in-app and email notifications.
- Needs a well-designed email template.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for performance issues if notification sending is not properly queued for a large number of users.
- Misconfiguration of the email server could lead to delivery failures.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Odoo `res.users` model (to get active users and email addresses).
- Odoo `mail.mail` and `mail.thread` objects (for sending notifications).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Verify validation rule for the 24-hour notice period.
- Verify validation rule for start/end time logic.
- Verify that inactive users are correctly excluded.
- Verify the cancellation flow and its corresponding notification.
- Verify email rendering in a test environment (e.g., using MailHog).

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- An Admin user account.
- Multiple active user accounts with valid, testable email addresses.
- At least one inactive user account.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for unit tests.
