"Cross-training & Skill Redundancy","Single points of failure exist for Odoo Architecture and DevOps skills.","Formalize a cross-training plan: 1) Pair the Senior Backend Developer with the Tech Lead on Odoo security model tasks. 2) Have the DevOps engineer train the Backend Developer on basic Kubernetes deployment and monitoring.","Reduces key person dependency risk by 40%. Increases team flexibility and bus factor.","80","8 weeks","At least one additional team member can confidently handle a P2 incident in each critical skill area.","Avoids potential 4-8 week project delays (worth >$100k) if a key person becomes unavailable."
"Automated E2E Testing","Over-reliance on manual E2E testing for complex workflows, which is slow and error-prone (RISK-004).","Allocate 1 sprint of QA Engineer's capacity (or 0.5 sprint for 2 sprints) to build an automated E2E test suite using Playwright for the 3 most critical workflows: Trip Creation-to-Payment, Driver Login-to-POD, and Expense Submission-to-Approval.","Increases regression detection by 70%. Reduces manual regression testing time by 50% per release cycle.","80","4 weeks","Critical path E2E tests run automatically as part of the CI pipeline on every pull request.","Saves approximately 20 hours of manual testing per regression cycle, and reduces risk of critical production bugs."
