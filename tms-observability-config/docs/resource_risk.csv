"RISK-001","External Dependency","The third-party GSP API is unreliable or has poor documentation, delaying the critical e-invoicing feature.","High","Critical","[""TASK-401"",""TASK-402"",""US-037"",""US-087"",""US-038""]","4","Develop a mock GSP server in parallel to unblock development. Enforce synchronous-with-asynchronous-fallback architecture.","Implement the manual IRN entry feature (US-038) as a priority to provide a business-level fallback.","GSP sandbox is not available by Sprint 9. API error rates in testing exceed 10%.","8000","3 weeks to implement mock server."
"RISK-005","Key Person Dependency","Project relies on single individuals for Frontend (OWL) and DevOps (EKS/Terraform), creating bottlenecks and high risk if a resource becomes unavailable.","Medium","High","[""TASK-301"",""TASK-9002"",""TASK-9041"",""US-064"",""US-029""]","8","Mandate pair programming on critical tasks. Enforce comprehensive documentation for all frontend components and infrastructure code.","Maintain a retainer with a specialized AWS/Odoo consultancy for emergency support.","Key documentation (e.g., deployment runbook) is not completed within one sprint of the feature.","20000","Ongoing."
"RISK-003","Data Quality","The one-time data migration fails due to poor data quality in the legacy system or incorrect mapping, jeopardizing the go-live.","High","Critical","[""US-089"",""US-090""]","6","Mandate at least two successful, stakeholder-validated dry-runs in staging. Develop comprehensive validation scripts early.","Prepare for a phased rollout, running the new system in parallel with the old one for one billing cycle if migration confidence is low.","First dry-run validation report shows more than 5% data mismatch.","25000","4 weeks for data cleansing and script refinement."
