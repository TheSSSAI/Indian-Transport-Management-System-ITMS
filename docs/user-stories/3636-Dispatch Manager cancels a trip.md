# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Cancel an assigned trip with a valid reason

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

A Dispatch Manager is logged in and is viewing a trip with the status 'Assigned' or 'In-Transit'

### 3.1.5 When

The user clicks the 'Cancel Trip' action, enters a reason (e.g., 'Customer cancelled order') into the mandatory text field, and confirms the action

### 3.1.6 Then

The trip's status is immediately updated to 'Canceled'. The cancellation reason is saved and displayed in the trip's event history (chatter). A notification is sent to the assigned driver informing them of the cancellation. The assigned vehicle and driver are marked as 'Available' if they are not assigned to another active trip.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the trip status change in the database and on the UI. Check the trip's chatter for the logged reason. Verify the notification is triggered. Check the status of the associated vehicle and driver records.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Attempt to cancel a trip without providing a reason

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

A Dispatch Manager is logged in and has initiated the 'Cancel Trip' action for an active trip

### 3.2.5 When

The user attempts to confirm the cancellation without entering any text in the mandatory reason field

### 3.2.6 Then

The system prevents the cancellation. A validation error message is displayed, such as 'A reason for cancellation is required'. The trip's status remains unchanged.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Confirm that the modal does not close, the error message appears, and the trip record's status is not modified.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Edge Case: Attempt to cancel a trip that is already delivered or completed

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.3.4 Given

A Dispatch Manager is logged in and is viewing a trip with a status of 'Delivered', 'Completed', 'Invoiced', or 'Paid'

### 3.3.5 When

The user views the available actions for the trip

### 3.3.6 Then

The 'Cancel Trip' action/button is not visible or is disabled, preventing the user from initiating the cancellation process.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Check the UI for trips in these final states to ensure the cancellation action is not available. This aligns with REQ-FNC-002.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Security: An unauthorized user attempts to cancel a trip

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

A user with a role other than 'Dispatch Manager' or 'Admin' (e.g., 'Finance Officer', 'Driver') is logged in

### 3.4.5 When

The user views an active trip record

### 3.4.6 Then

The 'Cancel Trip' action/button is not visible or is disabled.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Log in as each non-privileged role and verify that the cancellation control is not accessible.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Alternative Flow: User aborts the cancellation process

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Alternative_Flow

### 3.5.4 Given

A Dispatch Manager has opened the 'Cancel Trip' dialog for an active trip

### 3.5.5 When

The user clicks the 'Close' or 'Cancel' button in the dialog without confirming

### 3.5.6 Then

The dialog closes, and the trip's status remains unchanged.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Verify that no changes are saved to the trip record after aborting the action.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'Cancel Trip' button on the Trip Form view, placed logically with other state-changing actions.
- A modal dialog (wizard) that appears upon clicking the 'Cancel Trip' button.
- A mandatory multi-line text input field within the modal for the cancellation reason.
- A 'Confirm' button to execute the cancellation.
- A 'Cancel' or 'Close' button to abort the action.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The system must prevent form submission if the reason field is empty.
- Upon successful cancellation, the trip view should refresh to show the new 'Canceled' status.
- The cancellation reason should be clearly visible in the trip's history log or chatter for easy reference.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Trips with a 'Canceled' status should be visually distinct in list views, perhaps using a specific color or badge.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The modal dialog must be keyboard navigable.
- The mandatory reason field must be clearly indicated for screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-TRP-CANCEL-01

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A trip can only be canceled if its status is before 'Delivered'. This aligns with BR-004.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Server-side validation before changing the trip state.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The action is disallowed, and the UI control is hidden or disabled for trips in non-cancelable states.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-TRP-CANCEL-02

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A reason for cancellation is mandatory.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

UI and server-side validation upon submission of the cancellation request.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The cancellation is blocked, and an error message is displayed to the user.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-026

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the existence of a core Trip model and its basic lifecycle states.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-027

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the ability to assign vehicles and drivers to a trip, as their status must be updated upon cancellation.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-060

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the notification system to be in place to alert the assigned driver.

### 6.1.4.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.4.1 Story Id

US-070

#### 6.1.4.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) framework to restrict this action to authorized users.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo's ORM for state management and data persistence.
- Odoo's wizard/modal framework for the reason-input dialog.
- Odoo's notification/messaging system (`mail.thread`).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- The Trip data model must have a 'state' field that includes a 'canceled' value.
- The Trip data model must have a field to store the cancellation reason.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The state change and notification trigger should complete within 1 second of user confirmation.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The action must be protected by Odoo's access control lists (`ir.model.access.csv`) and record rules (`ir.rule`) to ensure only Dispatch Managers and Admins can perform it.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The process to cancel a trip should be intuitive and require no more than three clicks from the trip view.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The feature must function correctly on all supported browsers as defined in REQ-INT-001.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- This functionality follows standard Odoo development patterns (wizard for input, button to trigger a method).
- Logic for updating the status of related records (Vehicle, Driver) is straightforward but requires careful implementation to avoid race conditions or incorrect state changes.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The logic for determining a resource's 'Available' status must correctly handle cases where the resource is assigned to other, non-canceled trips.
- Potential for notification delivery failure. The notification should be logged, and its failure should not block the cancellation transaction.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Integrates with the Driver/Vehicle models to update their availability status.
- Integrates with the Notification system to send alerts.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements
