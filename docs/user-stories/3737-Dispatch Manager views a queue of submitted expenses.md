I am viewing the 'Expense Approvals' list

### 3.6.5 When

I use the standard Odoo search bar to filter by 'Driver' or click a column header like 'Amount' to sort

### 3.6.6 Then

The list should update to reflect the applied filter or sort order correctly.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Test the default sorting (e.g., by submission date, oldest first) and confirm that user-initiated sorting and filtering functions as expected.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A dedicated menu item under an 'Expenses' or 'Operations' menu, labeled 'Expense Approvals' or similar.
- An Odoo list (tree) view for displaying the queue.
- Standard Odoo search, filter, and grouping panel.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User clicks the menu item to access the queue.
- User can click on any column header to sort the list.
- User can click on any list item to navigate to its detailed form view.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The view must be pre-filtered to show only expenses in the 'Submitted' state.
- The default sort order should be by 'Submission Date' in ascending order (oldest first).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The view must adhere to Odoo's standard accessibility features, ensuring it is usable via keyboard navigation and screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'REQ-FNC-001', 'rule_description': "Only users with 'Dispatch Manager', 'Finance Officer', or 'Admin' roles can view the expense approval queue.", 'enforcement_point': 'Menu item visibility and server-side access control on the model.', 'violation_handling': 'Access is denied by the system.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-053

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story requires the ability for a driver to submit an expense, which creates the records that populate this queue.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-026

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the Trip model to exist, as expenses are linked to trips.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo 18 Web Framework (OWL)
- Odoo ORM and Access Control mechanism (`ir.model.access.csv`, `ir.rule`)

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires the existence of an 'Expense' model with a state field (e.g., 'draft', 'submitted', 'approved', 'rejected').
- Requires data relationships between Expense, Trip, Driver (hr.employee), and Vehicle models.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The expense queue list view must load in under 2 seconds for up to 1,000 pending records, as per REQ-NFR-001.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Access to this view must be strictly controlled via Odoo's group-based security rules, as defined in REQ-FNC-001 and REQ-NFR-003.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The view should be intuitive and follow standard Odoo conventions, requiring minimal training for a user familiar with the platform.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, leveraging Odoo's built-in accessibility features.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The view must render correctly on all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- This involves standard Odoo development patterns: creating an action, a menu item, and a view.
- No complex business logic is required for this specific story.
- The main task is ensuring the domain filter on the action is correct and the view displays the right fields from related models.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Potential for minor performance issues if the list view tries to fetch too many fields from related models without proper optimization. This risk is low.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- This view is a key integration point in the expense workflow, leading directly to the functionality in US-033 (Approve Expense) and US-034 (Reject Expense).

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify that a Dispatch Manager can see submitted expenses.
- Verify that a Dispatch Manager cannot see expenses in other states (draft, approved).
- Verify that a Driver cannot access the approval queue.
- Verify that clicking an item in the queue navigates to the correct detail form.
- Verify the view with an empty queue.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- User accounts for 'Dispatch Manager' and 'Driver' roles.
- Multiple expense records in various states ('draft', 'submitted', 'approved', 'rejected').
- Associated Trip, Vehicle, and Driver records.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Odoo's built-in Python testing framework for automated integration tests.
- Manual testing in a staging environment.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by at least one other developer
- Automated integration tests are created and passing in the CI pipeline
- The new menu item and view are visible only to authorized user roles
- The view's performance meets the specified NFR
- Functionality is verified in the staging environment by a QA engineer or product owner
- No regressions are introduced to related functionalities

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

1

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is a prerequisite for the expense approval/rejection stories (US-033, US-034) and should be completed in the same or an earlier sprint.
- It should be planned after the story for submitting expenses (US-053) is complete.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a core component of the expense management module. The module cannot be released without this functionality.
