AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Successful login with valid credentials

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a registered user with an active account, and I am on the TMS login page

### 3.1.5 When

I enter my correct email and password and click the 'Log In' button

### 3.1.6 Then

I am successfully authenticated, a session is created, and I am redirected to my role-specific dashboard.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Login attempt with an incorrect password

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

I am on the TMS login page and have entered a valid email for an active account

### 3.2.5 When

I enter an incorrect password and click the 'Log In' button

### 3.2.6 Then

The system displays a generic error message 'Invalid email or password.', I remain on the login page, and the password field is cleared.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the error message does not indicate whether the email or the password was incorrect to prevent user enumeration.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Login attempt with a non-existent email

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

I am on the TMS login page

### 3.3.5 When

I enter an email address that is not registered in the system and click the 'Log In' button

### 3.3.6 Then

The system displays the same generic error message 'Invalid email or password.' and I remain on the login page.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

This ensures the system does not confirm the existence of user accounts to unauthorized individuals.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Login attempt with an inactive account

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

I am a registered user whose account has been deactivated by an Admin

### 3.4.5 When

I enter my correct email and password and click the 'Log In' button

### 3.4.6 Then

The system prevents login and displays a specific error message, such as 'Your account is inactive. Please contact an administrator.'

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Create an inactive user account in the test data to verify this specific flow.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Login attempt with empty credentials

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.5.4 Given

I am on the TMS login page

### 3.5.5 When

I click the 'Log In' button without entering an email or a password

### 3.5.6 Then

The system prevents the form submission and displays inline validation messages indicating that both fields are required.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Check for standard HTML5 or framework-specific form validation behavior.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Password field masks input

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.6.4 Given

I am on the TMS login page

### 3.6.5 When

I type characters into the password field

### 3.6.6 Then

The characters are masked (e.g., displayed as dots or asterisks).

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Verify the input type of the password field is 'password'.

## 3.7.0 Criteria Id

### 3.7.1 Criteria Id

AC-007

### 3.7.2 Scenario

Login communication is secure

### 3.7.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.7.4 Given

I am on the TMS login page

### 3.7.5 When

I submit my login credentials

### 3.7.6 Then

The request is sent to the server over an HTTPS connection.

### 3.7.7 Validation Notes

Use browser developer tools to inspect the network request and confirm the protocol is HTTPS and the connection is secure (TLS 1.2+ as per REQ-INT-004).

- Password input field (masked)
- Log In button
- Area for displaying error messages

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User can type into input fields.
- User can click the 'Log In' button to submit the form.
- The form can be submitted by pressing 'Enter' in the password field.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The login page should be clean, professional, and consistent with the Odoo 18 UI.
- Error messages must be clear and user-friendly.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All form fields must have associated labels.
- The page must be fully navigable using a keyboard.
- Error messages must be programmatically associated with their respective fields for screen readers.
- Meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per REQ-INT-001.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

*No items available*

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo 18 framework, specifically its core authentication module (`res.users` model and associated controllers).
- A configured and running PostgreSQL database.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- At least one active user account must exist in the `res.users` table for testing.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- 95% of login attempts (from button click to redirect or error message) must complete in under 2 seconds, as per REQ-NFR-001.

## 7.2.0 Security

- All authentication traffic must be encrypted in transit using TLS 1.2 or newer (REQ-INT-004).
- The system must leverage Odoo's built-in protection against brute-force attacks (e.g., rate limiting).

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- This story primarily leverages Odoo's standard, out-of-the-box authentication functionality.
