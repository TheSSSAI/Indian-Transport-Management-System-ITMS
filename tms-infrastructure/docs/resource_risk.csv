"RISK-R001","Resource Bottleneck","The SRE/DevOps Engineer is over-allocated by 44% in Sprint 1, creating a critical bottleneck for all infrastructure tasks and delaying the entire project.","High","Critical","[""TASK-164"",""TASK-165"",""TASK-166"",""TASK-167"",""TASK-168""]","2","Immediately hire a part-time DevOps contractor for the first 2 sprints or aggressively re-plan Sprint 1 to defer non-essential infra tasks.","The senior backend developer takes over CI/CD setup, but with a 50% productivity penalty.","Any IaC task is more than 2 days behind schedule in the first week.","18000","1 week to onboard contractor."
"RISK-R002","Key Person Dependency","There is only one Frontend Developer, creating a single point of failure for all UI/UX related work, which starts in Sprint 3.","Medium","High","[""TASK-018"",""TASK-021"",""TASK-023""]","4","Pre-qualify an external UI contractor who can be brought in on short notice. Ensure all UI designs are componentized and well-documented.","Backend developers implement basic, functional UI with significant tech debt.","Any frontend task is blocked for more than 3 days.","20000","1 week to onboard contractor."
"RISK-R003","Resource Bottleneck","The QA Engineer is over-allocated in Sprint 1 and has no buffer in subsequent sprints. This will create a testing bottleneck, delay feedback, and compromise quality.","High","High","[""All development tasks""]","3","Shift quality left: mandate that developers write and maintain integration tests for all new features. The QA Engineer's primary focus should be on test planning, automation, and exploratory testing.","Reduce testing scope, accepting a higher risk of bugs in production.","The bug count for 'unverified' issues grows by 20% sprint-over-sprint.","","Immediate process change."
