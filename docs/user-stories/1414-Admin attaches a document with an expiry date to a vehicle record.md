# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A dedicated tab or section labeled 'Documents' on the vehicle form view.
- An 'Add Document' button to open a form or modal for new entries.
- A list/table view to display existing documents with columns for 'Document Type', 'Expiry Date', 'Uploaded On', and 'Actions'.
- A dropdown/selection field for 'Document Type' (e.g., RC, Insurance, Fitness Certificate).
- A date picker component for the 'Expiry Date' field.
- A file upload component with clear instructions on allowed formats and size limits.
- Action icons/buttons for 'View/Download', 'Edit', and 'Delete' for each document row.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking 'Add Document' opens a modal or a new form view.
- Uploading a file should provide visual feedback (e.g., file name appears, progress indicator).
- Saving the form should close the modal and refresh the document list on the vehicle form.
- Clicking a document link should open the file in a new tab.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The document list should be sorted by expiry date by default, with the soonest-expiring documents at the top.
- Expired documents should be visually highlighted in the list (e.g., red text or a warning icon).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All form fields must have associated labels.
- The file upload functionality must be keyboard-accessible.
- Action icons must have appropriate ARIA labels (e.g., 'Download document').

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'REQ-FNC-004-Ref', 'rule_description': 'Uploaded receipt/document files shall be restricted to common image and document formats (JPG, PNG, PDF) with a maximum file size of 5MB.', 'enforcement_point': 'Client-side validation on file selection and server-side validation upon file submission.', 'violation_handling': 'The file upload is rejected, and a specific error message is displayed to the user.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-006', 'dependency_reason': 'The core vehicle record model and its user interface must exist before documents can be attached to it.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo's attachment framework (`ir.attachment`).
- Configuration of Odoo's filestore to use Amazon S3 for production environments, as specified in REQ-DEP-001 and REQ-TEC-001. This may require a separate technical spike or setup task.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- A predefined list of 'Document Types' must be available. This should be implemented as a configurable master data model so that admins can add or remove types as needed.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- File upload of up to 5MB should complete within 10 seconds on a standard broadband connection.
- The vehicle form, including the list of documents, must load within 3 seconds.

## 7.2.0 Security

- Uploaded documents must be stored securely in the S3 bucket with appropriate access controls.
- Access to download/view documents must be restricted based on Odoo's role-based access control. Direct, unauthenticated URL access to files must be prevented (e.g., by using pre-signed URLs).
- Server-side validation must be implemented for file type and size to prevent malicious file uploads.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The process of adding a document should be intuitive and require minimal clicks.
- Error messages must be clear and guide the user on how to correct the issue.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, as stated in REQ-INT-001.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The feature must be fully functional on modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and on mobile-responsive views from 360px width upwards.

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- The primary complexity is the integration of Odoo's filestore with Amazon S3. If this is the first time the team is implementing this, it may require research and a separate setup task.
- Creating a new Odoo model (`tms.vehicle.document`) with a many-to-one relationship to the vehicle model is standard.
- Implementing robust client-side and server-side validation for file uploads.
- Ensuring secure file access via pre-signed URLs adds a layer of security logic.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Misconfiguration of S3 bucket policies could lead to data exposure or inaccessible files.
- Performance issues with large file uploads if not handled asynchronously.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- Odoo's base document management system (`ir.attachment`).
- Amazon S3 for object storage.
