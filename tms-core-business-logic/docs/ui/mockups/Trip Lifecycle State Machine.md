# 1 Diagram Info

## 1.1 Diagram Name

Trip Lifecycle State Machine

## 1.2 Diagram Type

stateDiagram-v2

## 1.3 Purpose

To visually document the complete state machine for a Trip record, detailing all possible statuses, the transitions between them, the triggering actions, and the roles responsible for each state change. This includes the primary success path from 'Planned' to 'Paid' and exception paths like 'On Hold' and 'Canceled'.

## 1.4 Target Audience

- developers
- QA engineers
- product managers
- business analysts

## 1.5 Complexity Level

# 3.0 Diagram Elements

## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Dispatch Manager
- Driver
- Finance Officer
- System (Automation)

## 3.2 Key Processes

- Trip Creation
- Resource Assignment
- Trip Execution
- Delivery Confirmation
- Financial Settlement
- Exception Handling

## 3.3 Decision Points

- Is event critical?
- Is trip status before 'Delivered'?
- Is resolution comment provided?

## 3.4 Success Paths

- Planned -> Assigned -> In-Transit -> Delivered -> Completed -> Invoiced -> Paid

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- Cancellation path (from Planned, Assigned, In-Transit, On Hold)
- On Hold / Disruption path (from In-Transit)

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- Cancellation from various states
- Automatic state change to 'On Hold' on critical event
- Manager-only resolution for 'On Hold' state
