# 3 Description

This repository contains the standalone, decoupled microservice responsible for ingesting real-time GPS data. Built with FastAPI for high performance, its function is to poll the third-party GPS provider's API, validate the received data against a strict contract, and publish it as a standardized 'VehicleLocationUpdated' event to a RabbitMQ message queue. This service is a critical component of the system's real-time tracking feature, designed for high throughput and resilience. Its isolation from the core monolith is a key architectural decision to prevent performance degradation of the main application from high-frequency I/O operations.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

PRESERVED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

tms-gps-ingestion-service

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

This repository was preserved in its original form as it already represents a well-defined, single-responsibility component (microservice) that is architecturally decoupled from the monolith, aligning perfectly with the decomposition goals.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

*No items available*

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- The pattern is reusable, but the implementation is specific to the chosen GPS provider.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Allows a specialist team to own and optimize the real-time data pipeline.
- Independent scaling and deployment based on telemetry volume.

# 21.0.0 Dependency Contracts

*No data available*

# 22.0.0 Exposed Contracts

## 22.1.0 Public Interfaces

- {'interface': 'AMQP Publisher', 'methods': [], 'events': ['VehicleLocationUpdated'], 'properties': [], 'consumers': ['REPO-GPS-CON']}

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Polling the GPS provider API.
- Publishing the canonical 'VehicleLocationUpdated' event.
- A '/health' endpoint for monitoring.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Any direct communication with the core application database.
- Any business logic related to trips or drivers.

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

*No items available*

## 25.4.0 Validation Rules

- Must enforce the data contract for all incoming data before publishing.
