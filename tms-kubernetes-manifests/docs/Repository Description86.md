tms-kubernetes-manifests

# 3 Description

This repository was preserved and contains all Kubernetes configuration manifests, likely structured as Helm charts or Kustomize overlays. It defines how the containerized applications (Odoo monolith, FastAPI microservice) are deployed, configured, and managed on the EKS cluster. Responsibilities include defining Deployments, Services, Ingress rules, ConfigMaps, and the mechanism for injecting secrets from AWS Secrets Manager. This repository acts as the bridge between the application build artifacts (Docker images) and the running infrastructure, embodying the principles of GitOps for application deployment.

# 20 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1 Operation Type

PRESERVED

## 20.2 Source Repository

tms-kubernetes-manifests

## 20.3 Decomposition Reasoning

This repository was preserved because it correctly separates the application deployment and runtime configuration from the application source code. This is a critical separation for enabling GitOps and clear ownership between development and operations teams.

## 20.4 Extracted Responsibilities

*No items available*

## 20.5 Reusability Scope

- The Helm chart structure can be templated and reused for other applications.

## 20.6 Development Benefits

- Provides a single source of truth for how the application runs in production.
- Automates and standardizes the deployment process.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- Deployment configurations for all services.
- Service exposure via Ingress.
- Configuration and secrets management.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- Infrastructure provisioning (handled by REPO-TMS-INFRA).
- Building Docker images (handled by application CI pipelines).

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- New services can be added by creating new Helm charts.
