## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

Security

### 3.6.4 Given

a user attempts to create a new trip record via a direct API call

### 3.6.5 When

the API request payload is missing the 'customer_id' field

### 3.6.6 Then

the server rejects the request with an appropriate error code (e.g., 400 Bad Request) and the response body contains a clear message indicating the missing required field.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Use an API client like Postman to send a POST request to the trip model's endpoint with an incomplete payload and verify the server's response.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- The 'Customer', 'Source', and 'Destination' fields on the Trip form.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Mandatory fields must be visually distinguished, typically with an asterisk (*).
- On an unsuccessful save attempt due to missing data, the system must prevent the form from closing and provide immediate visual feedback.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- A clear, consolidated error message should appear at the top of the form or near the save button.
- Individual fields failing validation must be highlighted (e.g., red border).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Fields with errors must have the `aria-invalid="true"` attribute set.
- Error messages must be associated with their respective fields programmatically for screen reader users.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-006', 'rule_description': 'A new trip record cannot be saved without a valid Customer, Source location, and Destination location.', 'enforcement_point': 'On save/create of a Trip record, both on the client-side (UI) and server-side (API/model).', 'violation_handling': 'The save operation is blocked. The system provides an error message to the user detailing the missing information.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-015

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

The Customer Master model and data must exist to select a customer for a trip.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-026

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The core 'Create New Trip' functionality, including the form view and underlying model, must be in place for this validation rule to be applied.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- The Odoo ORM and Views framework.
- The defined data model for Trips.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires at least one 'Active' customer record in the database for testing the happy path.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- Client-side validation feedback must be provided in under 200ms.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Server-side validation must be implemented to prevent circumvention of UI-level checks.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- Error messages must be clear, concise, and easily understandable by non-technical users.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- Validation feedback must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards for error identification.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- Validation behavior must be consistent across all supported browsers.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- This is a standard data validation feature in Odoo.
- Leverages built-in Odoo model attributes (`required=True`) and automatic UI rendering.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Minimal risk. The primary risk would be a misconfiguration of the required attribute on the model field.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- This validation is a core part of the Trip model's create/write methods in the Odoo ORM.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify successful creation with all required fields.
- Verify save failure for each missing required field individually.
- Verify save failure for multiple missing required fields.
- Verify UI feedback (highlighting, error messages) is correct.
- Verify via API that a request with missing required data is rejected by the server.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- An active customer record.
- Defined source and destination locations (if implemented as master data).

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Odoo's built-in testing framework (for unit tests).
- A web browser for manual E2E testing.
- An API client (e.g., Postman, Insomnia) for security/API testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code reviewed and approved by team
- Unit tests for model-level validation are implemented and passing with >80% coverage for the relevant code
- Integration testing completed successfully
- User interface reviewed and approved for clarity of error states
- Security requirements validated via API testing
- Documentation for the Trip model is updated to reflect mandatory fields
- Story deployed and verified in staging environment

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

1

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational requirement for trip creation and should be implemented in the same sprint as the initial Trip model and form (US-026).
- Blocking for any further trip lifecycle functionality.
