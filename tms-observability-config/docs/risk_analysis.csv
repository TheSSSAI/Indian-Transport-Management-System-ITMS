"RISK-001","External","The third-party GSP API for e-invoicing is unreliable or experiences downtime, preventing Finance Officers from generating legally compliant invoices. This directly impacts the core billing cycle and regulatory compliance as per REQ-1-006.","4","5","20","High","WI-401, WI-402, US-037, US-087: All tasks related to the trip-to-cash lifecycle and GST compliance.","Critical business function is dependent on an external service provider outside of the project's control.","Implement the designed synchronous-with-asynchronous-fallback mechanism (REQ-1-302). Select a GSP vendor with a strong SLA (e.g., 99.9% uptime). Implement proactive monitoring of the GSP API's health (error rates, latency) via the Alertmanager stack.","Document a manual failover process for Finance Officers to generate e-invoices directly on the government's GST portal during a prolonged GSP outage. The system must support manual entry of the generated IRN (US-038).","Prometheus alert fires when GSP API error rate exceeds 5% over a 15-minute window or p95 latency exceeds 5 seconds.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The complexity of the hybrid architecture (Odoo monolith + FastAPI microservice) leads to data consistency issues or communication failures via RabbitMQ, specifically for real-time GPS location data (REQ-1-013, REQ-1-301).","3","5","15","High","US-029 (Live Map View), US-080 (Geofence Alerts), WI-303. Any feature dependent on real-time vehicle location.","Distributed system complexity, potential for message loss in the queue, or failure of the consumer/producer.","Implement a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) in RabbitMQ to capture un-processable messages. Ensure the Odoo consumer job is idempotent to handle message redeliveries safely. Implement robust health checks and metrics for both the microservice and the Odoo consumer.","If the real-time pipeline fails, the system must degrade gracefully. The core TMS functions (trip creation, invoicing) must remain operational (REQ-1-013). An alert must notify the Admin to investigate the pipeline failure.","Alertmanager triggers if the RabbitMQ queue size exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 1000 messages) or if the DLQ contains any messages.","Lead DevOps/Backend Engineer","2025-07-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Quality","The one-time data migration from the legacy system (REQ-1-801) fails or results in corrupt/incomplete data, delaying the go-live or causing significant operational disruption post-launch.","4","5","20","High","US-089, US-090, Entire Go-Live Phase. Affects all users and business functions.","Poor data quality in the legacy system, incorrect data mapping, and insufficient validation during the migration process.","Mandate at least two full, successful dry-runs in the staging environment (REQ-1-801). Develop and execute comprehensive validation scripts that check record counts and reconcile financial totals (US-090). Involve business stakeholders in validating the dry-run results.","Develop a detailed rollback plan, including taking a final backup of the legacy system immediately before cutover. Allocate a 'hypercare' support period post-launch with a dedicated data team to address any identified issues.","Validation report from the dry-run (US-090) shows any record count mismatch or a financial reconciliation failure greater than 0.1%.","Project Manager / Data Migration Lead","2025-08-31","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Operational","The deployment and configuration of the complex infrastructure on AWS EKS using Terraform (REQ-1-014, EPIC-009) is delayed or misconfigured, leading to an unstable production environment and security vulnerabilities.","4","4","16","High","WI-901, WI-902, WI-912. All deployment and go-live activities.","High complexity of Kubernetes and IaC tools, combined with potential lack of specialized expertise within the team.","Mandate peer review of all Terraform and Kubernetes manifest files. Implement a CI/CD pipeline that automatically lints and validates IaC. Conduct a pre-production infrastructure audit by an external AWS/Kubernetes expert.","Maintain a simplified, non-containerized deployment script for a basic Odoo instance on an EC2 server as a last-resort disaster recovery option to bring up core (non-GPS) functionality if EKS fails catastrophically.","CI pipeline fails on `terraform validate` or `terraform plan` commands. Staging environment deployments are unstable or fail repeatedly.","DevOps Lead","2025-05-30","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Resource","The project's success is dependent on a small number of engineers with a rare combination of skills (Odoo, FastAPI, OWL, AWS EKS). The departure or unavailability of a key person could severely delay or derail the project.","3","4","12","Medium","All high-complexity work items, especially WI-303, WI-402, WI-901, WI-912.","Over-reliance on specialized knowledge not widely distributed across the team.","Enforce mandatory code reviews and pair programming sessions for all critical components. Create comprehensive technical documentation for the architecture, deployment process, and complex business logic. Cross-train at least one other developer on each critical system component.","Maintain a retainer contract with a specialized Odoo/AWS consultancy that can provide expert support on short notice if a key team member becomes unavailable.","Bus factor analysis shows a single point of failure for more than one critical component. Key documentation remains incomplete for more than two sprints.","Engineering Manager","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Performance","The system fails to meet performance targets (REQ-1-500, REQ-1-501) under a load of 100+ concurrent users, particularly in reporting modules and the live map view, leading to a poor user experience and operational inefficiencies.","3","4","12","Medium","US-029, US-036, US-045, US-064. Any user-facing feature with data aggregation or real-time updates.","Inefficient database queries for reports, frontend rendering bottlenecks in OWL, or insufficient scaling of the EKS cluster.","Conduct regular load testing against the staging environment using a realistic dataset. Implement database query analysis (EXPLAIN ANALYZE) for all complex queries. Use Odoo's performance profiling tools. Optimize frontend components by lazy-loading data and using efficient state management.","If performance targets are not met, de-scope non-critical dashboard widgets or implement data caching strategies using Redis (REQ-1-402). For reports, pre-aggregate data using scheduled jobs into summary tables.","Load testing results show p95 response times exceeding 200ms for key API endpoints. LCP for dashboard exceeds 3 seconds.","Lead QA Engineer","2025-08-01","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Security","An incorrect implementation of Odoo's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), particularly the record rules for data segregation (REQ-1-100), results in a data leak where a user (e.g., a Driver) can access unauthorized data (e.g., another driver's trip or financial details).","2","5","10","Medium","US-070, WI-002, US-047. All features that handle user-specific or sensitive data.","Complex or poorly written Odoo record rule domains (`ir.rule`) or incorrect security group assignments in `ir.model.access.csv`.","Mandate peer review of all security-related code (access files, record rules). Create a specific suite of integration tests that attempt to access data across roles (e.g., a test where Driver A tries to read Driver B's data). Conduct a manual security audit as part of the pre-release checklist.","If a data leak is discovered post-release, immediately apply a highly restrictive default-deny rule to the affected model and work on an emergency patch. The audit trail (REQ-1-207) will be used to assess the scope of the breach.","An integration test fails, where a low-privilege user successfully accesses data they should not be able to.","Lead Security Engineer / Senior Odoo Developer","2025-06-15","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Timeline","The user acceptance and training phase (US-091, US-092) is ineffective, leading to low user adoption, high error rates, and an increase in support requests post-launch. This could jeopardize the perceived success of the project.","3","3","9","Medium","Go-Live, US-091. Affects the transition and operational readiness of the business.","Training materials are unclear, not role-specific, or training sessions are poorly attended/executed.","Develop role-specific training materials (manuals for office staff, video tutorials for drivers). Conduct a pilot training session with a group of 'super users' to gather feedback before the main rollout. Make training completion a mandatory step for receiving production credentials.","Establish a 'hypercare' support team for the first 4 weeks post-launch to provide intensive, on-demand user support and conduct ad-hoc training sessions as needed.","Feedback from the pilot training session is negative. Attendance for scheduled training drops below 90%.","Project Manager / Training Lead","2025-09-01","Not Started"
