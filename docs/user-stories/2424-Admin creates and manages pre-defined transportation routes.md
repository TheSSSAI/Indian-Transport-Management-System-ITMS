# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A new menu item under a 'Configuration' or 'Master Data' section of the TMS module, labeled 'Routes'.
- A standard Odoo list/tree view to display existing routes with columns for Name, Source, Destination, and Distance.
- A standard Odoo form view for creating and editing a route.
- Input fields on the form: 'Route Name' (Text), 'Source' (Text), 'Destination' (Text), 'Standard Distance (km)' (Numeric), 'Estimated Transit Time (hours)' (Numeric, optional).

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Admin can create, edit, and view routes.
- The list view for routes must be searchable by Name, Source, and Destination.
- The list view should be sortable by any of the displayed columns.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- All created routes must be visible in the list view.
- Validation errors must be clearly displayed next to the corresponding fields on the form.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All form fields must have associated labels.
- Standard keyboard navigation (Tab, Enter) must be supported for form interaction.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-ROUTE-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

The 'Route Name' must be unique to prevent duplicate and confusing entries.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Database level (unique constraint) and on form save.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The system will display a validation error message, such as 'A route with this name already exists.', and prevent the record from being saved.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-ROUTE-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The 'Standard Distance (km)' must be a positive number greater than zero.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

On form validation before saving.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

The system will display a validation error and prevent the record from being saved.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-001', 'dependency_reason': 'An Admin user account must exist to perform this function.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Requires the base Odoo 18 framework.
- Requires the creation of a new Odoo model (e.g., `tms.route`) and associated views (list, form) and access control lists.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

- None. This story creates foundational data.

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

- None.

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The route management list view should load in under 2 seconds with up to 1,000 route records.
- Saving a new route should complete within 500ms.

## 7.2.0 Security

- Access to create, write, and delete route records must be restricted to the 'Admin' user group via Odoo's `ir.model.access.csv`.
- Read access may be granted to other internal user groups like 'Dispatch Manager' if needed for selection purposes in other stories.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The process of creating a route should be intuitive, following standard Odoo patterns for master data creation.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, consistent with the overall system requirement (REQ-INT-001).

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The interface must be fully functional on all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- This is a standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) feature, which is a core competency of the Odoo framework.
- Involves creating one new model, two views, one menu item, and access control rules.
- No complex business logic or external integrations are required.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Minimal risk. The primary consideration is ensuring the data model is robust enough for future needs (e.g., should 'Source' and 'Destination' be simple text fields or linked to a more complex address/location model?). For the initial implementation, text fields are sufficient as per REQ-DAT-004.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- The created `tms.route` model will be a key integration point for the Trip Management feature (US-028), where Dispatch Managers will select from these pre-defined routes.

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E
- Security

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Verify an Admin can create, read, update, and delete a route.
- Verify form validation for all fields (required, numeric, positive values, uniqueness).
- Verify that a user with the 'Dispatch Manager' role cannot see the 'Routes' menu item in Configuration and cannot create/edit routes.
- Verify that the search functionality on the list view works for all relevant fields.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- A set of at least 10-15 sample routes with varying names, sources, and destinations.
- Test data with invalid formats (e.g., text in numeric fields, negative numbers) to test validation.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for unit tests.
- Manual testing via the Odoo UI.
- Browser developer tools for checking UI behavior.

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing
- Code for the `tms.route` model, views, and security rules is written, reviewed, and merged
- Unit tests covering model constraints and validations are implemented and achieve >80% coverage for the new code
- Manual E2E testing confirms all user interactions and validations work as expected
- Security testing confirms that non-Admin roles cannot access the functionality
- The feature is deployed and verified in the staging environment without regressions
- Developer documentation for the new model is added if necessary

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

2

## 11.2.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- This is a foundational master data story. It should be prioritized early in the development cycle, as the Trip Creation feature (e.g., US-028) will depend on it.
- Low complexity makes it a good candidate for an early sprint to build momentum.

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

- This feature is a key enabler for the efficiency gains promised by the TMS. Its absence would significantly reduce the value of the trip planning module.
