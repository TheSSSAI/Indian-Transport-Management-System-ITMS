# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A new menu item in the Driver Portal navigation for 'My Earnings'.
- Two distinct sections on the page: 'Expense Reimbursements' and 'Incentives'.
- A date range filter component (e.g., dropdown with presets and a custom range option).
- Summary cards to display total unpaid amounts.
- List view for expenses and incentives with clear status indicators (e.g., color-coded tags).

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Driver can tap on a list item to potentially view more details (e.g., the receipt image for an expense).
- Applying a date filter should refresh the lists and totals without a full page reload (asynchronous update).

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- All monetary values must be displayed with the correct currency symbol (e.g., â‚¹).
- Dates should be in a consistent, easy-to-read format (e.g., DD-MMM-YYYY).
- The layout must be responsive and optimized for mobile screens as per REQ-INT-001.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Ensure sufficient color contrast for status indicators.
- All interactive elements (filters, buttons) must be easily tappable on a mobile device.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Backend API/Controller level, using Odoo's `ir.rule` for row-level security.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The system returns a 403 Forbidden or equivalent access error.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-FNC-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

The 'Total Approved Expenses (Unpaid)' summary must only include expenses with the status 'Approved'.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

Backend calculation logic for the summary API endpoint.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo's `hr.employee` model for driver identification.
- The custom expense management model.
- A new or existing model for tracking driver incentives.

- The 'My Earnings' page must load within 3 seconds on a standard mobile 4G connection.
- API response time for fetching compensation data should be under 500ms for a driver with up to 2 years of history.
- The system should use pagination for API calls if a driver has more than 100 records to display.

## 7.2.0.0 Security
