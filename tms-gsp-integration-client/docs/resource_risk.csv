"RISK-R001","Resource","Single point of failure for all DevOps and Infrastructure tasks (Terraform, EKS, CI/CD). Any delay, illness, or departure of the DevOps Engineer will critically impact the project timeline.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-003"",""TASK-008"",""TASK-009"",""TASK-010""]","4","Mandate comprehensive documentation (runbooks) for all infrastructure setup. Schedule pair programming sessions between DevOps and a senior backend developer for key tasks.","Pre-vet a freelance DevOps contractor who can be onboarded within one week in case of an emergency.","Any critical path DevOps task is delayed by more than 2 days.","20000","1 week to implement mitigation."
"RISK-R002","Skill Gap","The team has limited prior experience with the specific GSP API for e-invoicing. Underestimation of its complexity or undocumented behaviors could significantly delay the core financial workflow.","High","High","[""TASK-051"",""TASK-052"",""EPIC-004""]","3","Allocate a dedicated technical analysis task (TASK-050) at the beginning of Sprint 3 to de-risk the integration. Build a robust asynchronous fallback mechanism from day one.","The manual intervention workflow (US-038) serves as the primary business contingency. Ensure the finance team is trained on this manual process before go-live.","The GSP analysis task (TASK-050) fails to produce a clear integration plan within the first 3 days of Sprint 3.","","1 week."
"RISK-R003","Resource","High utilization of the Frontend Developer in Sprint 2 (92.7%) creates a bottleneck and leaves no buffer for unexpected complexity, especially in the high-risk task of integrating the e-signature library (TASK-045).","High","Medium","[""TASK-038"",""TASK-045"",""TASK-049""]","1.5","Shift one lower-priority frontend task from Sprint 2 to Sprint 3 to create a buffer. Prioritize the technical spike for the e-signature library to identify challenges early.","If the e-signature library proves too complex, the feature will revert to 'photo upload only' for POD to avoid delaying the sprint, and a new story will be created for e-signature.","The e-signature spike task (TASK-043) is not completed by the second day of Sprint 2.","","3 days."
