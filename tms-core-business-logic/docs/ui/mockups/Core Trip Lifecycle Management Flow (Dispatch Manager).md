# 1 Diagram Info

## 1.1 Diagram Name

Core Trip Lifecycle Management Flow (Dispatch Manager)

## 1.2 Diagram Type

sequenceDiagram

## 1.3 Purpose

Provides a detailed technical specification for orchestrating the entire business process of a trip, from initial creation by a Dispatch Manager to final payment recording by a Finance Officer. This sequence diagram details the specific ORM method calls, business rule validations, state transitions, and user interactions required to implement the trip lifecycle as defined in business rule BR-004. It serves as a blueprint for developers to implement the state machine and associated logic within the Odoo framework.
