### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- Kubernetes
- Helm
- Kustomize
- YAML

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Deployment must target a high-availability Amazon EKS cluster as specified in REQ-1-014.
- Must adhere to GitOps principles, where this repository is the single source of truth for the application's runtime state.
- Configuration must support a hybrid architecture of a modular monolith (Odoo) and a decoupled microservice (FastAPI) as per REQ-1-013.

### 2.1.5.0.0 Analysis Insights

This repository is the definitive implementation of the GitOps pattern for the TMS application. Its core function is to translate architectural requirements into declarative Kubernetes resources. The primary implementation vehicle will be Helm charts for packaging the Odoo and FastAPI applications, with Kustomize or environment-specific values files handling the configuration drift between dev, staging, and production environments.

# 3.0.0.0.0 Requirements Mapping

## 3.1.0.0.0 Functional Requirements

- {'requirement_id': 'REQ-1-014', 'requirement_description': "The system's deployment environment shall be hosted on AWS and orchestrated using containers. The production environment shall be a high-availability Amazon EKS cluster, utilizing Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL 16 and Amazon S3 for storing all file attachments.", 'implementation_implications': ['Helm charts must be created for each deployable application component (Odoo monolith, FastAPI microservice).', 'Templates must define Kubernetes Deployments, Services, Ingress, ServiceAccounts, and ConfigMaps.', 'Configuration for connecting to external RDS and S3 services must be parameterized and injected via secrets and config maps.'], 'required_components': ['Helm Chart (Odoo)', 'Helm Chart (GPS Microservice)'], 'analysis_reasoning': 'This requirement is the central charter for this repository. All generated manifests directly contribute to fulfilling this specification by defining the entire Kubernetes-based deployment on AWS.'}

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Availability

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

Achieve a minimum uptime of 99.9% (REQ-1-502). Recovery Point Objective (RPO) is 15 minutes, and Recovery Time Objective (RTO) is 4 hours.

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

Kubernetes Deployment templates must be configured for high availability.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Use multiple replicas ('replicas: 3') for production deployments.
- Implement 'podAntiAffinity' rules to distribute pods across different nodes and availability zones.
- Define a 'PodDisruptionBudget' to ensure a minimum number of replicas are always available during voluntary disruptions.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The Kubernetes manifests are the primary mechanism for implementing the application-level high availability strategy required by the system's NFRs.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

All sensitive credentials shall be stored in AWS Secrets Manager and dynamically injected into the application's runtime environment (REQ-1-503).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The repository must not contain any secrets in plain text. It must implement a pattern for secure secret injection.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- Deploy a Kubernetes operator like the External Secrets Operator or configure the AWS Secrets and Configuration Provider (ASCP).
- Helm chart templates will define 'ExternalSecret' custom resources or appropriate volume mounts to reference secrets from AWS Secrets Manager.
- Utilize IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) to grant pods permission to access specific secrets, which will be defined in a 'ServiceAccount.yaml' template.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is a critical security constraint that directly influences the design of the Kubernetes manifests, moving from simple Secret definitions to a more robust external provider pattern.

### 3.2.3.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.3.1.0 Requirement Type

Observability

#### 3.2.3.2.0 Requirement Specification

The system shall implement a comprehensive monitoring and logging stack using Prometheus, Fluentbit, and Grafana/OpenSearch (REQ-1-602).

#### 3.2.3.3.0 Implementation Impact

Application pod templates must include specific metadata (annotations) to integrate with the monitoring stack.

#### 3.2.3.4.0 Design Constraints

- The 'deployment.yaml' template's metadata section must include annotations like 'prometheus.io/scrape: 'true'' and 'prometheus.io/port: 'metrics-port''.
- Assume a Fluentbit DaemonSet is deployed on the cluster; no specific configuration is needed here other than ensuring applications log to stdout in JSON format.

#### 3.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The manifests in this repository are responsible for making the application components discoverable by the cluster's observability tools, thus enabling the fulfillment of REQ-1-602.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The repository's primary purpose is to translate the deployment, availability, security, and observability NFRs into concrete, declarative Kubernetes resources. It acts as the technical manifestation of the system's operational and infrastructure requirements.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The entire state of the application deployment, including resource configurations, replicas, and networking rules, is defined as version-controlled YAML files within this repository.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- Helm Charts
- Kustomize Overlays (optional)
- Kubernetes Manifests

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

All Kubernetes objects will be defined in Helm chart templates. Environment-specific settings will be managed in separate 'values.yaml' files. The repository will be the single source of truth for deployments.

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern ensures deployments are repeatable, auditable, and can be managed through a declarative, version-controlled workflow, which is a modern standard for cloud-native applications.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

GitOps

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

Changes to the application's deployed state are driven by commits to this Git repository. An automated agent (e.g., ArgoCD, Flux) running in the EKS cluster will monitor this repository and automatically apply any changes.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- Git Repository (this repo)
- GitOps Controller (deployed in EKS)
- CI/CD Pipeline

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

The CI/CD pipeline for application code will be configured to update the image tag in this repository's 'values.yaml' upon a successful build. The GitOps controller will then detect this change and trigger a 'helm upgrade'.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

GitOps provides a robust, auditable, and automated deployment workflow that aligns perfectly with the goal of managing Kubernetes applications declaratively.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

Git is the central communication bus for the entire GitOps workflow.

### 6.2.2.0.0 Protocol Type

#### 6.2.2.1.0 Protocol Type

Kubernetes API (HTTPS/REST)

#### 6.2.2.2.0 Implementation Requirements

The GitOps controller requires a ServiceAccount with appropriate RBAC permissions to manage resources (Deployments, Services, etc.) within the target namespaces.

#### 6.2.2.3.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the standard, secure protocol for all interactions with the Kubernetes cluster.

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

*No items available*

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis is derived entirely from the cached context. The repository's role is defined by its description and type. The implementation details are dictated by the linked requirement REQ-1-014 and several cross-cutting NFRs (REQ-1-502, REQ-1-503, REQ-1-602), as well as the overarching architectural patterns (REQ-1-013, REQ-1-400).

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Identified REQ-1-014 as the primary driver for this repository.
- Selected Helm as the primary packaging tool due to its maturity for managing complex applications like Odoo.
- Incorporated HA, security, and monitoring NFRs as specific configurations within the Helm chart templates.
- Defined a GitOps workflow as the deployment pattern to align with the declarative nature of Kubernetes.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Validated the assumption that this repository is purely for IaC and does not build code.
- Validated the assumption that a GitOps controller will be available in the EKS cluster to act on this repository's contents.

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Checked REQ-1-014 (deployment environment) against REQ-1-502 (HA) and REQ-1-503 (secrets) to ensure the Kubernetes manifests can satisfy all constraints simultaneously.
- Cross-referenced the architecture diagram (REQ-1-400) to confirm that manifests for both the Odoo monolith and the FastAPI microservice must be created.
