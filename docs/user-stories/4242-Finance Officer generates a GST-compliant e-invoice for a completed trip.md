# 3 Acceptance Criteria

## 3.1 Criteria Id

### 3.1.1 Criteria Id

AC-001

### 3.1.2 Scenario

Happy Path: Successful e-invoice generation for a completed trip

### 3.1.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.1.4 Given

I am a logged-in Finance Officer and there is a trip in the 'Completed' state with all required customer and rate information

### 3.1.5 When

I navigate to the trip record and click the 'Generate Invoice' button, review the auto-populated invoice details, and click 'Generate E-Invoice'

### 3.1.6 Then

the system successfully communicates with the GSP API, receives a valid Invoice Reference Number (IRN) and signed QR code, updates the invoice status to 'Invoiced', updates the trip status to 'Invoiced', and makes the compliant PDF invoice (with IRN and QR code) available for download.

### 3.1.7 Validation Notes

Verify the trip and invoice statuses are updated in the database. Check the generated PDF to ensure it contains the IRN and QR code as per GST norms.

## 3.2.0 Criteria Id

### 3.2.1 Criteria Id

AC-002

### 3.2.2 Scenario

Attempting to generate an invoice for a trip not in 'Completed' state

### 3.2.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.2.4 Given

I am a logged-in Finance Officer and there is a trip in a state other than 'Completed' (e.g., 'In-Transit', 'Delivered')

### 3.2.5 When

I navigate to that trip record

### 3.2.6 Then

the 'Generate Invoice' button is either disabled or not visible, preventing me from initiating the invoicing process.

### 3.2.7 Validation Notes

Check the UI on trip forms with statuses 'Planned', 'Assigned', 'In-Transit', and 'Delivered' to confirm the action is not available. This enforces BR-010.

## 3.3.0 Criteria Id

### 3.3.1 Criteria Id

AC-003

### 3.3.2 Scenario

Invoice generation fails due to GSP API unavailability or server error

### 3.3.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.3.4 Given

I am a Finance Officer attempting to generate an e-invoice

### 3.3.5 When

the GSP API is unreachable or returns a server-side error (e.g., 5xx status code)

### 3.3.6 Then

the system flags the invoice for 'Manual Intervention', logs the API error details, and generates a high-priority alert on the dashboard for the Finance Officer role, as per REQ-FNC-006.

### 3.3.7 Validation Notes

Simulate a GSP API failure using a mock server. Verify the invoice status is updated correctly and a visible alert is created for the Finance Officer.

## 3.4.0 Criteria Id

### 3.4.1 Criteria Id

AC-004

### 3.4.2 Scenario

Invoice generation is rejected by GSP due to invalid data

### 3.4.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.4.4 Given

I am a Finance Officer attempting to generate an e-invoice for a trip with incorrect data (e.g., invalid customer GSTIN)

### 3.4.5 When

I submit the invoice for generation

### 3.4.6 Then

the system receives a validation error from the GSP API and displays a user-friendly message explaining the specific error (e.g., 'Invalid GSTIN provided for the customer'), allowing me to correct the data and retry.

### 3.4.7 Validation Notes

Test with known invalid data (e.g., incorrect GSTIN format, missing HSN code). Verify the GSP's error message is presented clearly to the user.

## 3.5.0 Criteria Id

### 3.5.1 Criteria Id

AC-005

### 3.5.2 Scenario

Invoice details are correctly auto-populated from the trip record

### 3.5.3 Scenario Type

Happy_Path

### 3.5.4 Given

I am a Finance Officer and I initiate invoice generation for a 'Completed' trip

### 3.5.5 When

the invoice creation form is displayed

### 3.5.6 Then

all relevant fields, including Customer Name, Billing Address, GSTIN, Material, Weight, Rate, and calculated Total Amount, are pre-filled accurately from the trip record, as per US-086.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Create a trip with specific details. Generate the invoice and compare every field on the invoice form with the source trip data to ensure a 1:1 match.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Asynchronous handling of GSP API timeouts

### 3.6.3 Scenario Type

Edge_Case

### 3.6.4 Given

I am a Finance Officer and I have submitted an invoice for generation

### 3.6.5 When

the synchronous API call to the GSP times out

### 3.6.6 Then

the system provides immediate feedback that the request is 'Processing', adds the task to a background queue for automatic retries with exponential backoff, and updates the invoice status asynchronously upon receiving a final response from the GSP.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Simulate a network timeout. Verify the UI shows a 'Processing' state and that a job is added to the RabbitMQ queue. Later, verify the status is updated correctly after the job succeeds or fails.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A 'Generate Invoice' button on the form view of 'Completed' trips.
- An invoice form with clearly labeled, pre-populated fields.
- A 'Generate E-Invoice' button to submit the invoice to the GSP.
- A loading indicator/spinner while the system communicates with the GSP.
- A non-intrusive notification area for success or error messages.
- A 'Download PDF' button on a successfully generated invoice.
- A dedicated area on the invoice view to display the IRN and QR code.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User clicks a button to start the process.
- User reviews pre-filled data and has the ability to correct minor details if permissions allow.
- User confirms the generation, triggering the API call.
- User receives clear visual feedback on the status of the request (processing, success, failure).

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The final invoice must display all mandatory fields as per Indian GST e-invoicing law.
- The Invoice Reference Number (IRN) and the GSP-signed QR code must be prominently displayed on the final invoice screen and PDF.
- Failed invoices must clearly show the reason for failure.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All buttons and form fields must be properly labeled for screen readers.
- Sufficient color contrast for text and UI elements as per WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-010

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

An invoice can only be generated for a trip that is in the 'Completed' state.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

The UI shall prevent the action (e.g., disable button) for trips not in the 'Completed' state. The backend shall validate the trip status before processing the request.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

UI: Action is unavailable. API: Request is rejected with a 403 Forbidden or 400 Bad Request error and a descriptive message.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-011

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

All system-generated invoice numbers must follow the sequential format: INV/YYYY/NNNNN.

### 5.2.3 Enforcement Point

During the creation of the invoice record, before submission to the GSP.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

This is a system-enforced rule; user interaction is not expected to violate it. System failure to generate a valid number should result in a logged error.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

13

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- Requires access to GSP API documentation and sandbox credentials before the sprint begins.
- The development team may need a dedicated session to understand the intricacies of the GSP's API and the e-invoicing data schema.
- This story may need to be broken down into smaller technical tasks (e.g., UI, API client, async worker).

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a critical feature for the financial module and a key requirement for the system's go-live. It is a dependency for any payment tracking functionality.
