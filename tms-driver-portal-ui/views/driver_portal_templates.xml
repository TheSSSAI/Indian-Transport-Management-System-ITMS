    This file contains the main QWeb template that serves as the root HTML document
    for the Driver Portal Single Page Application (SPA). The controller defined in
    `controllers/main.py` renders this template.

    Dependencies:
    - REQ-1-001: The viewport meta tag is critical for mobile responsiveness.
    - REQ-1-112: The simplified UI starts with this clean HTML shell.
    - main.py (Level 6): The controller will render this specific template by its ID.
    - assets.xml (Level 7): The asset bundle defined there is loaded here via t-call-assets.
    - main.js (Level 5): The JS code will mount the root OWL component into the `div.o_driver_portal_root`.
