"TEST-SEC-001","Security & Access Control","Security","System","Critical","true","High","Verify that a user with the 'Driver' role cannot access any data or views belonging to the 'Finance Officer' role, specifically the Customer Ledger.","Critical - Unauthorized access to financial data can lead to data breaches, compliance violations, and loss of customer trust.","Medium","User accounts with 'Driver' and 'Finance Officer' roles exist. Customer records with financial transactions exist.","1. Login as the 'Driver' user. 2. Attempt to navigate directly to the Customer Ledger URL. 3. Attempt to make a direct API call to the ledger data endpoint using the driver's session token. 4. Verify no financial menu items are visible in the UI.","All attempts to access the ledger (UI or API) result in a clear 'Access Denied' (403 Forbidden) error.

"TEST-E2E-001","Trip Lifecycle Management","Functional","E2E","Critical","true","Very High","Verify the complete 'happy path' trip lifecycle: from creation by a Dispatch Manager to POD upload by a Driver and completion by the manager.","High - Failure in the core trip lifecycle blocks all operational workflow.","High","Users for 'Dispatch Manager' and 'Driver' roles exist. Master data (Customer, Vehicle) is populated.","1. Login as Dispatch Manager. 2. Create a new trip (US-026). 3. Assign a vehicle and driver (US-027), verify status changes to 'Assigned'. 4. Login as Driver. 5. Start the trip (US-049), verify status changes to 'In-Transit'. 6. Upload a POD (US-052), verify status changes to 'Delivered'. 7. Login as Dispatch Manager, verify POD is visible and complete the trip.","The trip successfully transitions through all states (Planned -> Assigned -> In-Transit -> Delivered -> Completed) with all data and attachments preserved correctly.","Users for each role, vehicle, customer, route, material master data.","Playwright, Odoo Test Framework","8","24","8","US-026, US-027, US-049, US-052","Staging Environment with all services running.","100% successful completion of the workflow with all status changes and data validated.","Critical - Core business process is broken.","Every release.","High","Archive or delete created trip and related records.","Ensures role handoffs and permissions work correctly throughout the workflow.","Each state transition should complete within 2 seconds.","Driver portal steps must be mobile-friendly and meet WCAG 2.1 AA."
"TEST-INT-005","Financial Management & Compliance","Integration","Integration","Critical","true","High","Verify the resilient e-invoicing workflow (REQ-1-302) by simulating a GSP API timeout and confirming the request is enqueued for asynchronous retry.","Critical - Failure to generate e-invoices blocks revenue collection and violates legal compliance (RISK-001).","High","A completed trip and a posted invoice exist. RabbitMQ is running. A mock GSP API server is configured.","1. Configure the mock GSP API to respond with a 30-second delay. 2. As Finance Officer, trigger 'Generate E-Invoice'. 3. Verify the UI immediately responds with a 'Queued for processing' message. 4. Check RabbitMQ management console to confirm a new job is in the e-invoice queue. 5. Configure the mock GSP API to respond with success. 6. Wait for the Odoo job runner to process the queue. 7. Verify the invoice status is eventually updated to 'Invoiced' and the IRN is populated.","The system gracefully handles the API timeout by falling back to the async queue, and the invoice is successfully processed once the external service recovers.","A posted invoice for a B2B customer.","Pytest, Odoo Test Framework, Mockoon (or similar mock server), RabbitMQ Management UI","6","16","6","US-037, REQ-1-302, RabbitMQ setup","Integration environment with access to a mock server and RabbitMQ.","UI response is immediate; job is queued successfully; invoice is eventually updated upon retry.","Critical - User is blocked, and invoice generation fails silently.","Every release.","Medium","Clear RabbitMQ queue, reset invoice status.","N/A","UI feedback within 2 seconds.","N/A"
"TEST-PERF-002","GPS Tracking & Geofencing","Performance","System","High","true","Medium","Verify the end-to-end latency of the GPS data pipeline under load, from ingestion to database update, as per REQ-1-501.","High - High latency makes the 'real-time' tracking feature useless and impacts operational decision-making (RISK-005).","High","The full GPS pipeline (FastAPI microservice, RabbitMQ, Odoo consumer) is deployed. Performance monitoring tools are in place.","1. Start a load test script that sends simulated GPS updates for 500 vehicles at a rate of 1 update per vehicle every 30 seconds. 2. Run the test for 30 minutes. 3. During the test, measure the time difference between the log timestamp in the FastAPI microservice and the 'write_date' timestamp in the Odoo vehicle location table. 4. Calculate the 95th percentile (P95) of this latency.","The P95 latency for GPS location updates is under the 10-second threshold defined in REQ-1-501.","500 vehicle records in the database.","Locust (or JMeter), Prometheus, Grafana, PostgreSQL client","8","20","10","Full deployment of the hybrid architecture (REQ-1-013).","Dedicated Performance Testing environment, a scaled-down replica of production.","P95 latency < 10 seconds.
