The client, an Indian transport company owner, requires a robust, scalable, and user-friendly Transport Management System (TMS) developed as an Odoo 18 addon. The system will digitize and manage all logistics operations, aiming to optimize vehicle utilization, reduce paperwork, and provide real-time visibility. It will be a web-based application with a mobile-friendly interface for both internal staff and drivers.

Key functionalities include:
*   **Trip Management:** Creation and management of trips, assigning vehicles, routes, and drivers. Detailed recording of trip information (source, destination, material, weight, customer, rates, delivery dates, payment status).
*   **Master Data Management:**
    *   **Vehicle Master:** Stores vehicle details (number, model, capacity, owner, service history) and manages document expiry reminders (PUC, insurance, fitness) with document attachment capabilities.
    *   **Driver Master:** Tracks driver license details, performance, assigned vehicles, salary, and trip-wise incentives, along with document expiry alerts.
*   **Operational Control:** Trip status updates (assigned, in-transit, delivered, canceled), GPS integration for live tracking, and geofencing.
*   **Financial Management:** Records diesel and toll expenses, calculates trip profitability, generates invoices, tracks trip-wise expense vs. revenue, and maintains customer ledgers. It will support GST-compliant e-invoicing and export reports (Excel/PDF).
*   **Expense Management:** Drivers can add runtime expenses via the mobile-friendly web interface. Backend staff can add non-trip-related vehicle expenses (maintenance, document renewals).
*   **Alerts:** Document expiry reminders for vehicles and drivers. <<$Change>> Alerts for low balances in FASTag and diesel cards based on manually entered balances and configurable thresholds. <<$Change>>
*   **Driver Interface (Mobile-friendly web UI):** <<$Change>> The mobile-friendly web interface for drivers <<$Change>> enables them to receive trip assignments, update delivery status with proof of delivery (photo/e-signature), view past trips, and request advances or leave.
