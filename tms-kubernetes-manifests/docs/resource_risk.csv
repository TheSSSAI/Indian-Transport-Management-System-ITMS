"RISK-R001","Resource","Single point of failure in Frontend (1 developer) and DevOps (1 part-time engineer). Loss of either resource would halt progress in their respective areas.","Medium","High","[""All Frontend tasks"",""All Deployment tasks""]","4","Implement pair programming for knowledge transfer. Mandate comprehensive documentation. Pre-vet external contractors for rapid backfilling.","Engage pre-vetted contractor on short notice. Shift priorities to backend-only tasks if frontend resource is lost.","Over 80% of tasks in a skill area are consistently assigned to one person.","30000","2 weeks to onboard contractor."
"RISK-R002","Capacity","Backend and QA teams are significantly over-utilized (161% utilization based on required hours vs capacity), leading to high risk of burnout, reduced quality, and timeline slippage.","High","High","[""All Backend tasks"",""All QA tasks""]","3","Augment the team with one Mid-level Backend Developer and one Manual QA contractor to handle regression and E2E testing load.","Descope non-essential features or extend the project timeline by at least 2 sprints.","Sprint velocity consistently drops below 80% of planned story points. Bug reopen rate exceeds 15%.","45000","3 weeks to hire and onboard."
"RISK-R003","Skill Gap","Incorrect implementation of Odoo RBAC, especially 'ir.rule' for drivers, leading to a critical data breach. The complexity is high and expertise is concentrated in one senior developer.","Medium","Critical","[""TASK-US070-02"",""TASK-US070-03"",""TASK-US070-06""]","1","Mandate pair programming for all security rule implementations. Develop automated integration tests specifically for these rules. Allocate a large, dedicated manual testing cycle for RBAC validation.","Have an emergency hotfix plan to deploy an overly restrictive rule (deny all) in case of a post-launch discovery, buying time for a proper fix.","Automated security tests fail. Manual QA finds any data leakage between roles.","","1 week for hotfix development."
