"RISK-001","External","The system's core functionalities of e-invoicing and real-time tracking are critically dependent on third-party GSP and GPS provider APIs. API outages, high latency, rate-limiting, or unannounced breaking changes can disrupt these core business processes, impacting revenue collection and operational visibility.","4","5","20","High","E-Invoice Generation (WI-020), Live Map View (WI-025), GPS Data Ingestion (WI-022)","Dependency on external services outside of the project team's control, which have their own operational and technical risks.","Implement specified resilient integration patterns: a sync/async fallback mechanism with a background job queue for GSP API calls (REQ-1-302) and an exponential backoff retry policy for the GPS polling microservice (REQ-1-301). Select vendors with strong Service Level Agreements (SLAs) and stable, well-documented APIs. Implement comprehensive monitoring on API error rates and latency.","For a prolonged GSP outage, activate a documented manual process for Finance Officers to generate IRNs via the government's web portal and update the system using the 'Mark as Manually Processed' feature (US-038). For GPS outages, operations will rely on manual status updates from drivers via the portal.","A Prometheus alert fires if the GSP or GPS API error rate exceeds 5% over a 10-minute window, or if the 95th percentile latency exceeds 2 seconds.","Lead Backend Developer","2025-06-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","The one-time data migration from the legacy system (REQ-1-801) carries a high risk of data corruption, incorrect field mapping, or incomplete data transfer. Failure in migrating active customers or open invoices accurately could halt business operations on day one and destroy user trust.","3","5","15","High","Data Migration Execution (REQ-1-801), Production Go-Live","Potential for 'dirty' or undocumented data in the legacy system; complexity in data transformation logic between two different schemas.","Mandate and execute at least two successful, fully validated dry-runs in the staging environment before scheduling the production cutover (REQ-1-801). Develop and automate comprehensive validation scripts that compare record counts, financial totals, and data checksums between the source extract and the target database.","Prepare a detailed and tested rollback plan, including the procedure for restoring the production database from the pre-migration backup. Allocate an extended cutover window (e.g., 24 hours) to allow for issue resolution or a full rollback if validation fails.","The automated validation script reports any data discrepancy greater than 0% during a dry-run. Any unhandled exception or critical error occurs during the production migration script's execution.","Lead Data Engineer / Admin","2025-09-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","The infrastructure stack (AWS EKS, Terraform, RabbitMQ) is powerful but complex. A misconfiguration in network policies, IAM roles, or Kubernetes deployments could lead to critical security vulnerabilities, system instability, or significant downtime, potentially violating the 4-hour RTO.","3","5","15","High","Infrastructure Provisioning (WI-028, WI-029), CI/CD Pipeline Implementation (WI-032)","High complexity of modern cloud-native infrastructure and the potential for human error in manual configuration or IaC scripting.","Enforce that 100% of the infrastructure is defined as code (Terraform) and stored in version control. Mandate peer reviews for all infrastructure code changes. Implement a blue-green or canary deployment strategy in the CD pipeline to minimize the blast radius of a failed deployment. Conduct a full, simulated disaster recovery drill before go-live.","Maintain versioned infrastructure code and container images to allow for quick rollbacks of both infrastructure (via Terraform) and application (via Kubernetes) changes. Have a documented manual deployment process as an emergency backup.","A Terraform plan shows unintended destructive changes to production resources. The CI/CD deployment pipeline fails. Post-deployment automated smoke tests fail.","DevOps Lead","2025-07-31","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","The project plan emphasizes unit and integration testing but designates End-to-End (E2E) testing as manual. Given the complex, interdependent workflows (e.g., Trip Lifecycle, GPS-to-Alert), there is a high risk that critical integration bugs will be missed, leading to significant failures during UAT or in production.","4","4","16","High","User Acceptance Testing, Production Go-Live, All major epics (EPIC-003, EPIC-004, EPIC-005)","Over-reliance on manual testing for complex, multi-component workflows, which is error-prone and less repeatable than automated testing.","Allocate dedicated QA resources to develop and execute a formal E2E test plan covering all critical user stories. Automate at least the primary 'happy path' E2E scenarios for core workflows (Trip Creation-to-Payment, Driver Expense Submission-to-Approval) using a framework like Playwright or Cypress integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.","Schedule a 'hyper-care' period of 2-4 weeks post-launch with dedicated developer and QA resources on standby to rapidly address production issues discovered due to testing gaps. Prepare a rapid hotfix deployment process.","More than 5 critical or major bugs are discovered during User Acceptance Testing (UAT) that were not caught by existing unit or integration tests.","QA Lead","2025-08-31","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Resource","The project requires a diverse and advanced skill set (Odoo 18/OWL, FastAPI, AWS EKS, Terraform, RabbitMQ). Unidentified skill gaps within the development team could lead to suboptimal architectural decisions, implementation delays, security flaws, and increased technical debt.","3","4","12","Medium","All development and infrastructure work items.","The breadth of the technology stack exceeds typical team specializations, creating a risk of key person dependencies or areas of weak expertise.","Conduct a formal team skills matrix assessment against the required technologies. Prioritize peer programming and rigorous code reviews for components where expertise is thin. Allocate a budget and timeline for targeted training or for securing short-term external expert consultation, especially for EKS/Terraform setup.","If critical skill gaps in infrastructure cannot be filled, simplify the architecture by replacing EKS with a less complex orchestration service like AWS Fargate. For development, extend timelines to allow for learning and upskilling on complex components like OWL.","Consistently low velocity, high number of pull request revisions, or a high bug-to-feature ratio is observed in a specific technology area (e.g., infrastructure, frontend) over two consecutive sprints.","Project Manager / Tech Lead","2025-05-31","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Technical","The real-time GPS ingestion pipeline, consisting of a microservice, RabbitMQ, and an Odoo consumer, could become a performance bottleneck under high load. Failure to meet the <60s end-to-end latency NFR (REQ-1-105) would render the live tracking feature unreliable and useless for dispatchers.","3","4","12","Medium","GPS Ingestion Microservice (WS-008), Odoo GPS Data Consumer and Map View (WS-009)","Potential for inefficient data processing in the consumer, network latency, or an underscaled microservice, leading to message queue buildup and processing delays.","Conduct targeted load testing on the entire GPS pipeline, simulating the expected production load of vehicles. Ensure the Odoo consumer processes messages in efficient batches and uses optimized database writes. Implement fine-grained monitoring on RabbitMQ queue depth and message processing latency.","Design the GPS microservice and Odoo consumer to be horizontally scalable. If the microservice is the bottleneck, increase its pod count in EKS. If the Odoo consumer is the bottleneck, increase the number of Odoo workers dedicated to background jobs.","A Prometheus alert fires if the RabbitMQ queue depth for location updates consistently exceeds 1000 messages or if the end-to-end data latency metric (from ingestion to DB write) consistently exceeds 45 seconds.","Lead Backend Developer","2025-08-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Technical","The data segregation for the 'Driver' role relies on Odoo's record rules (`ir.rule`) (REQ-1-100). A poorly written or non-indexed rule can cause severe database performance degradation, especially on list views, potentially violating the <200ms API response NFR and making the driver portal unusable.","4","3","12","Medium","Implement Driver's Trip List and Detail View (WI-014), All Driver Portal features requiring data access.","Record rules are applied to all database queries for a given model, and if not optimized, can prevent the use of database indexes, leading to full table scans.","Ensure all `ir.rule` domain filters are written to be 'sargable' (can use database indexes). Add database indexes to all fields used in record rules. Conduct specific load tests on API endpoints accessed by the Driver role to measure the performance impact of the rules.","If a record rule proves to be unperformant, refactor it. As a last resort, replace it with a less flexible but more performant security mechanism, such as applying security logic directly in the backend controller methods, though this is less ideal.","The p95 response time for the Driver's trip list API endpoint exceeds 500ms during load testing. The number of slow queries in the PostgreSQL logs related to driver access increases significantly.","Lead Odoo Developer","2025-07-15","Not Started"
