# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is a prerequisite for accurate vehicle profitability reporting. It should be prioritized before or alongside the 'Vehicle Profitability Report' story (US-068).

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This feature is critical for the financial module's completeness. Its absence would leave a significant gap in vehicle cost tracking.
