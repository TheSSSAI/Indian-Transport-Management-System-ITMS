# 3 Description

This repository, preserved in its original form, centralizes the configuration for the entire observability stack as code. It contains Prometheus alerting rules (Alertmanager), Grafana dashboard definitions (as JSON models), and Fluent Bit parsing configurations. This approach ensures that the monitoring and alerting strategy is version-controlled, auditable, and can be deployed automatically alongside the application and infrastructure. It provides a consistent and reproducible observability setup across all environments, which is critical for maintaining system reliability and meeting SLOs.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

PRESERVED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

tms-observability-config

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

This repository was preserved as it follows the 'as-code' paradigm for a non-application concern (observability). Separating it from other repositories ensures that monitoring can be managed and evolved independently by an SRE or platform team without interfering with application development.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

*No items available*

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- Generic dashboards and alerting rules (e.g., for Kubernetes) are highly reusable.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Treats monitoring configuration as a first-class citizen of the software development lifecycle.
- Enables automated validation and deployment of monitoring changes.

# 25.0.0 Scope Boundaries

## 25.1.0 Must Implement

- All alerting rules for defined SLOs.
- Key Grafana dashboards for system health.
- Log parsing rules for structured logs.

## 25.2.0 Must Not Implement

- The installation of the monitoring tools themselves (handled by REPO-TMS-K8S).
- Application metric instrumentation (handled in application repositories).

## 25.3.0 Extension Points

- New dashboards and alerts can be added as new files.

## 25.4.0 Validation Rules
