Must be executed by a senior developer.","Could be split among mid-level developers, but increases risk of misconfiguration and would require 30% more time for coordination and review.","Incorrectly configured record rules can cause major data leaks or block legitimate access, severely impacting all other features.","Mandatory peer review by another senior developer and comprehensive E2E testing for each user role.","16","9.6","6.4","12","8"

Requires a senior full-stack or Odoo developer.","Implement synchronous-only flow first, which reduces complexity but fails to meet resilience requirements (REQ-1-302).","High risk of GSP API being unstable or poorly documented (RISK-001). Sync/async logic is complex to test.","Conduct a technical spike on the GSP sandbox API early. Implement a mock GSP server for robust unit/integration testing.","26","10.4","5.2","15","12"

Collaboration with a business SME is essential.","Use Odoo's standard import tools, but this is not recommended due to the need for complex data cleansing and transformation logic.","Poor legacy data quality, undocumented fields, and potential for financial reconciliation errors (RISK-003). High time pressure during cutover.","Mandatory, full-scale dry-run in staging (as per req). Allocate buffer time in the project plan for at least two dry-run iterations.","40","24","16","20","10"
