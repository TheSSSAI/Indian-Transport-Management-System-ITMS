# 2 Repository Analysis

## 2.1 Repository Definition

### 2.1.1 Scope Boundaries

- Primary responsibility is to store, version, and manage the declarative configurations for the entire observability stack as code.
- Secondary responsibility is to provide a single source of truth for monitoring, logging, and alerting rules, enabling automated and repeatable deployments of the observability platform.

### 2.1.2 Technology Stack

- Prometheus (for metrics and alerting rules)
- Grafana (for dashboard JSON models and datasource provisioning)
- Fluent Bit (for log parsing and routing configurations)
- YAML/JSON (as the configuration languages)

### 2.1.3 Architectural Constraints

- Configurations must support deployment on Amazon EKS, leveraging Kubernetes-native features like service discovery.
- The repository must not contain any secrets (e.g., API keys, passwords); configurations must reference secrets injected at runtime from AWS Secrets Manager per REQ-1-503.

#### 3.1.1.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Requires creation of 'prometheus/prometheus.yml' with scrape configurations for application pods.
- Requires creation of 'prometheus/rules/' with alerting rules for technical events.
- Requires creation of 'fluentbit/' configurations to define input from containers, filters for metadata enrichment, and output to OpenSearch.
- Requires creation of 'grafana/provisioning/' to define datasources (Prometheus, OpenSearch) and dashboards.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- Prometheus configuration files (prometheus.yml, rules/*.yml)
- Alertmanager configuration (alertmanager.yml)
- Grafana provisioning files (datasources.yml, dashboards.yml) and dashboard models (*.json)
- Fluent Bit pipeline configuration (fluent-bit.conf, parsers/*.conf, etc.)

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This repository is the direct implementation of the configuration aspect of REQ-1-602, defining how each specified tool should operate and interact.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-680

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

Application logs must be written in a structured JSON format.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- The Fluent Bit configuration will be simplified, using a JSON parser instead of complex, brittle regex parsers.
- This reduces CPU overhead on the logging agent and improves the reliability of log processing.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- Fluent Bit parser configuration (e.g., 'fluentbit/parsers/json.conf')

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement dictates the parsing strategy to be implemented in the Fluent Bit configurations within this repository, simplifying the implementation and improving performance.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Availability

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

Achieve 99.9% uptime (REQ-1-502).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

The Prometheus and Alertmanager configurations must define rules to monitor application health, SLOs (e.g., error budgets, latency), and infrastructure status, triggering alerts when availability is at risk.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- Alerting rules must be sensitive enough to detect real issues but configured to avoid alert fatigue.
- Grafana dashboards must be created to visualize availability metrics and SLOs over time.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This repository's configurations are the primary mechanism for measuring and enforcing the availability NFR.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Performance

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

API GET requests < 200ms, LCP < 3s (REQ-1-500).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

Prometheus configurations will define scrape targets for application metrics, including latency histograms and summaries. Grafana dashboards will be built to visualize these metrics (e.g., 95th percentile latency). Alertmanager rules will be defined to fire if these performance targets are breached.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- Prometheus scrape intervals and rule evaluation frequencies must be tuned to provide timely data without overloading the system.
- Dashboard queries must be optimized to load quickly.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

### 3.2.3.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.3.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.3.2.0 Requirement Specification

Secrets must be managed in AWS Secrets Manager (REQ-1-503).

#### 3.2.3.3.0 Implementation Impact

Configurations that require credentials (e.g., Grafana datasource passwords, Alertmanager notifier API keys) must not contain plaintext secrets. They will use placeholder syntax to reference environment variables that are injected from AWS Secrets Manager at runtime.

#### 3.2.3.4.0 Design Constraints

- The repository must be free of any hardcoded secrets.
- Deployment scripts are responsible for fetching secrets and injecting them into the environment of the observability services.

#### 3.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This NFR enforces a strict security posture on the content of this repository, separating configuration from sensitive credentials.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The repository directly translates high-level observability requirements (REQ-1-602) into concrete, version-controlled configuration files. It is the cornerstone for making non-functional requirements like availability and performance measurable and enforceable through alerting.

It demonstrates how a change in application state (a metric) flows through the system to become a human-readable notification.'}

## 6.2.0.0.0 Communication Protocols

- {'protocol_type': 'YAML/JSON', 'implementation_requirements': 'All files must adhere to the strict syntax of their respective formats. Tools and CI pipelines must use appropriate parsers and validators.', 'analysis_reasoning': "YAML and JSON are the standard, human-readable data serialization formats used by the entire observability stack for configuration, making them the primary 'protocol' for this repository."}

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

Dependency Risk

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

The effectiveness of all configurations in this repository is critically dependent on application teams correctly instrumenting their code to expose metrics and provide structured logs. There is no enforcement mechanism within this repository to validate that dependency.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

Requires establishing a strong 'contract' between the platform/SRE team and application developers. This should be enforced through CI checks in the *application* repositories, not this one.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

If applications fail to provide the correct data, the entire observability stack will be blind, representing a significant operational risk.

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Configuration Management

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

Managing environment-specific variables (e.g., OpenSearch hostnames, different alert thresholds) is not explicitly defined in the repository's base structure and requires a formal strategy.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

An overlay tool like Kustomize or a templating engine (e.g., Helm for Kubernetes) must be chosen and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline to manage environment-specific configurations without duplicating the entire config tree.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

Medium

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Without a clear strategy, there is a high risk of configuration drift between environments, leading to 'it works in staging but not in prod' issues.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

Analysis was performed by synthesizing the repository's definition with specific requirements (REQ-1-602, REQ-1-680), the architectural definition of the 'Infrastructure & Operations Layer', and relevant non-functional requirements (Availability, Performance, Security).

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Repository scope was defined as 'configuration-only' based on its description and technology stack.
- Integration patterns were derived from the responsibilities outlined in REQ-1-602 and the specified tools.
- Critical findings were identified by analyzing the repository's external dependencies (application instrumentation) and common challenges in managing infrastructure as code (environment separation).

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Validated the assumption that this repo is 'config as code' against REQ-1-602, which specifies the *configuration* of the stack.
- Validated the assumption of Kubernetes deployment against REQ-1-014 (AWS EKS).

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Cross-referenced REQ-1-680 (Structured JSON logs) with Fluent Bit configuration plans to confirm a simplified parsing strategy.
- Cross-referenced REQ-1-502 (Availability) and REQ-1-500 (Performance) with Prometheus/Alertmanager capabilities to confirm this repository is the tool for implementing those NFRs' observability.
