- An Amazon S3 bucket must be created for file attachments.
- All resources must be tagged and configured for the specified AWS region.

#### 3.1.1.4.0 Required Components

- terraform/aws/modules/eks
- terraform/aws/modules/rds
- terraform/aws/modules/s3

#### 3.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement directly translates to the core resources that must be defined as code within this repository.

### 3.1.2.0.0 Requirement Id

#### 3.1.2.1.0 Requirement Id

REQ-1-402

#### 3.1.2.2.0 Requirement Description

The project shall adhere to the specified technology stack, including Redis, RabbitMQ, API Gateway, and Secrets Manager.

#### 3.1.2.3.0 Implementation Implications

- Terraform code must provision an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis instance.
- An Amazon MQ for RabbitMQ instance must be provisioned.
- An AWS API Gateway endpoint must be configured to expose the GPS microservice.
- AWS Secrets Manager must be provisioned to store all system credentials.

#### 3.1.2.4.0 Required Components

- terraform/aws/modules/elasticache
- terraform/aws/modules/mq
- terraform/aws/modules/api_gateway
- terraform/aws/modules/secrets_manager

#### 3.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This requirement expands the scope of infrastructure to be provisioned beyond the core components of REQ-1-014, covering the full stack.

## 3.2.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

### 3.2.1.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.1.1.0 Requirement Type

Availability & Recovery

#### 3.2.1.2.0 Requirement Specification

99.9% uptime, RPO 15 mins, RTO 4 hours (REQ-1-502).

#### 3.2.1.3.0 Implementation Impact

This is a critical driver for the infrastructure topology. All stateful components must be deployed in a highly available configuration.

#### 3.2.1.4.0 Design Constraints

- The EKS cluster's node groups must be configured across multiple Availability Zones (AZs).
- The Amazon RDS instance must be deployed in a Multi-AZ configuration.
- RDS must have Point-In-Time-Recovery (PITR) enabled with a backup retention policy that supports the 15-minute RPO.

#### 3.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

Failure to implement these design constraints in the Terraform code will result in a direct violation of the availability and recovery NFRs.

### 3.2.2.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.2.1.0 Requirement Type

Security

#### 3.2.2.2.0 Requirement Specification

All sensitive credentials shall be stored in AWS Secrets Manager and never hardcoded (REQ-1-503).

#### 3.2.2.3.0 Implementation Impact

The Terraform code must create the necessary Secrets Manager secrets and the IAM roles/policies that grant the EKS pods access to retrieve them at runtime.

#### 3.2.2.4.0 Design Constraints

- Terraform resources for 'aws_secretsmanager_secret' must be defined.
- Terraform configurations must not contain plaintext secrets; they should be passed in securely during CI/CD execution.
- IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) should be used in EKS to grant pods fine-grained access to secrets.

#### 3.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This NFR mandates a specific security pattern that must be provisioned and configured within this repository.

### 3.2.3.0.0 Requirement Type

#### 3.2.3.1.0 Requirement Type

Monitoring

#### 3.2.3.2.0 Requirement Specification

The system shall implement a comprehensive monitoring and logging stack with Prometheus, Fluentbit, OpenSearch, etc. (REQ-1-602).

#### 3.2.3.3.0 Implementation Impact

The infrastructure must support this stack. Terraform will be responsible for provisioning the managed components and the necessary permissions.

#### 3.2.3.4.0 Design Constraints

- An Amazon OpenSearch Service domain should be provisioned via Terraform.
- Security groups and network ACLs must be configured to allow log and metric flow between EKS and OpenSearch.
- IAM roles and policies must be created to allow Fluentbit pods to write to OpenSearch and Prometheus to scrape metrics.

#### 3.2.3.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This NFR requires specific infrastructure to be provisioned, which falls squarely within the scope of this repository.

## 3.3.0.0.0 Requirements Analysis Summary

The repository is primarily driven by technical and non-functional requirements that define the cloud environment. REQ-1-014 sets the core components, while NFRs like REQ-1-502 (HA/DR) and REQ-1-503 (Security) dictate the specific, high-quality implementation topology of those components.

# 4.0.0.0.0 Architecture Analysis

## 4.1.0.0.0 Architectural Patterns

### 4.1.1.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.1.1.0 Pattern Name

Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

#### 4.1.1.2.0 Pattern Application

The entire cloud environment is defined declaratively using Terraform (HCL). This enables versioning, automated provisioning, and consistent, reproducible environments.

#### 4.1.1.3.0 Required Components

- Terraform CLI
- AWS Provider for Terraform
- GitHub Actions Runner

#### 4.1.1.4.0 Implementation Strategy

A modular approach will be used. Core infrastructure components (VPC, EKS, RDS) will be defined in reusable Terraform modules within a 'modules/' directory. Environment-specific configurations ('dev', 'staging', 'prod') will reside in an 'environments/' directory, consuming these modules with different variable inputs ('.tfvars').

#### 4.1.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This pattern is explicitly required by the technology stack (REQ-1-402) and is the industry best practice for managing cloud infrastructure at scale, ensuring maintainability and reducing manual error.

### 4.1.2.0.0 Pattern Name

#### 4.1.2.1.0 Pattern Name

Remote State Management

#### 4.1.2.2.0 Pattern Application

Terraform state files will be stored remotely in an AWS S3 bucket with state locking enabled via a DynamoDB table.

#### 4.1.2.3.0 Required Components

- terraform/aws/backend.tf
- AWS S3 Bucket
- AWS DynamoDB Table

#### 4.1.2.4.0 Implementation Strategy

The 'backend.tf' configuration file will define the S3 backend. The S3 bucket and DynamoDB table themselves will be provisioned manually or via a separate, minimal bootstrap Terraform configuration, as they are a prerequisite for the main infrastructure state.

#### 4.1.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is critical for team collaboration, preventing state corruption and enabling secure, consistent CI/CD operations. It is a non-negotiable best practice for any production Terraform setup.

## 4.2.0.0.0 Integration Points

### 4.2.1.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.1.1.0 Integration Type

Cloud Provider API

#### 4.2.1.2.0 Target Components

- AWS

#### 4.2.1.3.0 Communication Pattern

Synchronous API Calls

#### 4.2.1.4.0 Interface Requirements

- Terraform AWS Provider (version pinned in 'versions.tf')
- Valid AWS credentials with sufficient permissions, managed via CI/CD secrets.

#### 4.2.1.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

This is the primary integration point. Terraform translates the HCL configuration into a series of API calls to AWS to provision and manage resources. Version pinning ensures predictable behavior.

### 4.2.2.0.0 Integration Type

#### 4.2.2.1.0 Integration Type

CI/CD Pipeline

#### 4.2.2.2.0 Target Components

- GitHub Actions
- Application Deployment Scripts

#### 4.2.2.3.0 Communication Pattern

Data-on-Read via Terraform Outputs

#### 4.2.2.4.0 Interface Requirements

- A defined set of Terraform outputs ('outputs.tf') that expose critical resource identifiers like EKS cluster name, RDS endpoint ARN, S3 bucket names, etc.
- Deployment scripts must be able to consume these output values to target the correct infrastructure.

#### 4.2.2.5.0 Analysis Reasoning

The Terraform outputs form the public contract of this repository. They are the mechanism by which the provisioned infrastructure's details are passed to the application deployment phase.

# 7.0.0.0.0 Critical Analysis Findings

## 7.1.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.1.1.0.0 Finding Category

Design Requirement

### 7.1.2.0.0 Finding Description

The High Availability NFR (REQ-1-502) requires Multi-AZ deployments for EKS and RDS. This significantly impacts the complexity and cost of the infrastructure and must be a primary design consideration from the outset.

### 7.1.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

Terraform modules for EKS and RDS must be designed to support Multi-AZ configurations as a mandatory, non-negotiable feature for production environments.

### 7.1.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.1.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

Failure to implement Multi-AZ from the beginning will lead to a violation of core NFRs and require a costly and disruptive re-architecture later.

## 7.2.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.2.1.0.0 Finding Category

Security

### 7.2.2.0.0 Finding Description

The secrets management strategy (REQ-1-503) requires a robust IAM implementation, likely using IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA) in EKS, to provide least-privilege access from pods to AWS Secrets Manager.

### 7.2.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

The EKS Terraform module must include configurations for the OIDC provider and the creation of IAM roles that can be associated with Kubernetes service accounts.

### 7.2.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.2.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

A secure-by-design approach is critical. Implementing IRSA correctly is complex but provides the most secure method for AWS service access from within Kubernetes.

## 7.3.0.0.0 Finding Category

### 7.3.1.0.0 Finding Category

Maintainability

### 7.3.2.0.0 Finding Description

The wide range of services to be provisioned (EKS, RDS, S3, MQ, ElastiCache, etc.) necessitates a highly modular Terraform structure. A monolithic Terraform configuration would be unmaintainable.

### 7.3.3.0.0 Implementation Impact

A strict module-per-service structure must be enforced (e.g., 'modules/eks', 'modules/vpc', 'modules/rds'). Environment configurations in 'environments/' should only compose these modules and pass variables.

### 7.3.4.0.0 Priority Level

High

### 7.3.5.0.0 Analysis Reasoning

A modular structure is the only viable approach to manage the complexity of this stack, allowing for independent testing, versioning, and reuse of infrastructure components.

# 8.0.0.0.0 Analysis Traceability

## 8.1.0.0.0 Cached Context Utilization

The analysis extensively cross-references the repository definition with specific functional (REQ-1-014, REQ-1-402) and non-functional (REQ-1-502, REQ-1-503, REQ-1-602) requirements to derive the necessary Terraform resource configurations. Architectural documents were used to confirm the role of this repository as the foundational 'Infrastructure & Operations Layer'.

## 8.2.0.0.0 Analysis Decision Trail

- Identified REQ-1-014 as the core scope driver.
- Identified REQ-1-502 as the primary driver for topological decisions (Multi-AZ).
- Determined a modular Terraform structure is non-negotiable due to the complexity outlined in REQ-1-402.
- Mapped the CI/CD interaction based on standard IaC best practices and the GitHub Actions requirement in REQ-1-402.

## 8.3.0.0.0 Assumption Validations

- Validated that 'containers' in REQ-1-014 implies a Kubernetes-based orchestrator like EKS, which is confirmed by the tech stack in REQ-1-402.
- Validated that the RPO/RTO in REQ-1-502 can be met with standard AWS managed service features (RDS Multi-AZ and PITR).

## 8.4.0.0.0 Cross Reference Checks

- Confirmed the PostgreSQL 16 version from REQ-1-402 is supported by Amazon RDS, as required by REQ-1-014.
- Cross-referenced the architectural pattern of a decoupled microservice (REQ-1-013) with the need to provision Amazon MQ (RabbitMQ) as per REQ-1-402.
- Verified that all technologies listed in REQ-1-402 that require dedicated infrastructure (EKS, RDS, S3, ElastiCache, MQ, API Gateway, Secrets Manager) are accounted for in the implementation plan for this repository.
