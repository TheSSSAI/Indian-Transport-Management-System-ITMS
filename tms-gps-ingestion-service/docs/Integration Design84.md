## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-013

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system architecture shall be a hybrid model, consisting of a modular monolith (the Odoo TMS addon) for core application logic and a separate, decoupled microservice specifically for ingesting high-volume GPS location data.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Review the architectural diagrams and confirm the separation of the Odoo monolith and the GPS ingestion microservice.
- Verify that the Odoo application can function (excluding live tracking) if the GPS microservice is offline.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- The service must be built and deployed as a completely independent process from the Odoo monolith.
- Communication between this service and the monolith must be asynchronous to maintain decoupling.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement directly mandates the existence and purpose of this repository as the 'separate, decoupled microservice' for GPS data ingestion, defining its primary architectural role.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-301

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

The system shall integrate with a third-party GPS provider via a dedicated, asynchronous microservice. This microservice is responsible for polling the GPS API, validating the data against a fixed contract ({ "vehicle_identifier": "string", "latitude": float, "longitude": float, "timestamp": "ISO 8601 string" }), and publishing it to a RabbitMQ message queue. The microservice must implement robust error handling, including exponential backoff for API polling failures and a dead-letter queue (DLQ) for persistently un-processable messages.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Demonstrate that when the GPS provider API is temporarily unavailable, the microservice retries the connection using an exponential backoff strategy.
- Inject a malformed message into the RabbitMQ queue and verify that after several failed processing attempts by the Odoo consumer, it is moved to the DLQ.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- The service must implement a polling loop with a configurable interval.
- A strict data validation layer (e.g., using Pydantic) must be used to enforce the specified contract before publishing.
- The service must use an AMQP client library (e.g., aio-pika) to publish messages to a configured RabbitMQ exchange.
- Error handling for HTTP requests must include a retry mechanism with exponential backoff.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement provides the detailed functional specification for the service, defining its core responsibilities (poll, validate, publish), the exact data contract for its output, the integration technology (RabbitMQ), and the mandatory error handling patterns.

### 1.2.3.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.3.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-401

#### 1.2.3.2 Requirement Text

The decoupled microservice for GPS data ingestion shall be developed using the Python FastAPI framework. The final artifact for this microservice must be a self-contained Docker image, separate from the Odoo application's Docker image.

#### 1.2.3.3 Validation Criteria

- Review the source code for the microservice and confirm it is built with FastAPI.
- Verify the existence of a dedicated Dockerfile for the microservice that builds and packages it correctly.

#### 1.2.3.4 Implementation Implications

- The repository's technology stack is mandated to be Python 3.11 and FastAPI.
- A Dockerfile must be included in the repository to create the container image.
- Dependencies must be managed via a pyproject.toml file.

#### 1.2.3.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement explicitly defines the technology stack (FastAPI) and the final deployment artifact (Docker image) for the service contained within this repository.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

- {'component_name': 'GPS Ingestion Service', 'component_specification': "A high-performance, standalone Python microservice built with FastAPI.

It validates incoming location data (latitude, longitude, timestamp, vehicle ID) against a strict contract and publishes valid data as a 'VehicleLocationUpdated' event to a RabbitMQ message queue. It is designed for resilience, implementing exponential backoff for polling failures and must be packaged as a Docker container for deployment.", 'implementation_requirements': ['Must be implemented using Python 3.11 and the FastAPI framework.', 'Must use Pydantic for strict data validation of incoming API data and the outgoing event schema.', "Must use an asynchronous AMQP library like 'aio-pika' for publishing events to RabbitMQ.", 'Must be fully stateless to allow for horizontal scaling.', "Must include a '/health' endpoint for Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes."], 'architectural_context': "This component is the implementation of the 'GPS Ingestion Microservice' layer. It acts as a specialized, decoupled service to offload high-frequency I/O from the core monolithic application, following the Microservice architectural pattern.", 'extraction_reasoning': "This component is the central focus and the entirety of the repository's scope. Its specification is synthesized from the repository's description and its mapped requirements (REQ-1-013, REQ-1-301, REQ-1-401)."}
