# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- An interactive map canvas (e.g., using Odoo Map view with OpenStreetMap or another provider).
- Custom vehicle markers/icons.
- Info-windows for displaying trip details on marker click.
- Zoom in/out controls.
- A message overlay for the 'no vehicles in transit' case.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User can pan the map by clicking and dragging.
- User can zoom using the scroll wheel or on-screen controls.
- Clicking a marker opens an info-window; clicking the map or an 'x' icon closes it.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The map must be responsive and usable on mobile devices as per REQ-INT-001.
- Vehicle markers must be clearly distinguishable, especially if they are close together.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Map controls must be keyboard-accessible.
- Information in the info-window must be readable by screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-MAP-001', 'rule_description': "Only vehicles assigned to trips with the status 'In-Transit' shall be displayed on the map.", 'enforcement_point': 'Data query for the map view.', 'violation_handling': 'Vehicles in other states are filtered out and not sent to the frontend.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-027

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

A trip must be created and have a vehicle assigned to it before it can be tracked.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-049

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

A driver must be able to change a trip's status to 'In-Transit' to make it appear on the map.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Completion of the GPS data ingestion pipeline (FastAPI microservice, RabbitMQ message queue, and Odoo consumer job) as specified in REQ-ARC-001 and REQ-INT-003.
- A data model within Odoo (likely an extension of the Vehicle Master) to store the last known latitude, longitude, and timestamp for each vehicle.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- A live, reliable data feed from the third-party GPS provider's API.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

- Availability and stability of the third-party GPS Provider API.

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- End-to-end latency for a GPS data point (from device to UI update) must be under 10 seconds, with a maximum of 60 seconds as per REQ-FNC-003.
- The map view must load with all markers within 3 seconds on a standard broadband connection (LCP as per REQ-NFR-001).

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Access to the map view must be restricted to authorized roles (Dispatch Manager, Admin) as per REQ-FNC-001.
- API endpoints serving location data to the frontend must be secured and only accessible to authenticated users.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The map should be intuitive to navigate, with standard pan and zoom controls.
- The info-window should present information clearly and concisely.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature should strive to meet WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per REQ-INT-001.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The map view must function correctly on all modern web browsers supported by Odoo 18 and be fully responsive on screen sizes from 360px width upwards.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

High

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- The primary complexity is in ensuring the real-time data pipeline is robust, scalable, and low-latency.
- Frontend complexity involves efficiently handling real-time data updates on the map without performance degradation, potentially requiring websockets or efficient polling.
- Integrating a third-party mapping library into an Odoo OWL component requires careful implementation.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- The GPS data ingestion pipeline could become a bottleneck or point of failure.
- The third-party GPS provider API may have reliability issues, rate limits, or breaking changes.
- Performance degradation on the map UI if a very large number of vehicles are in transit simultaneously.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Odoo Backend <-> RabbitMQ (consuming location data).
- Odoo Frontend (OWL) <-> Odoo Backend (API to fetch initial and updated locations).
- GPS Ingestion Microservice <-> Third-Party GPS Provider API.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Simulate a high volume of GPS updates to test the performance of the data pipeline and frontend rendering.
- Simulate API failure from the GPS provider to test error handling and the 'stale data' indicator.
- Test the map view on various screen sizes, including mobile phones and tablets.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A set of test vehicles and trips in various statuses ('Planned', 'Assigned', 'In-Transit', 'Delivered').
- A script or tool to mock the GPS provider API and send simulated location data to the ingestion microservice.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for backend unit/integration tests.
- A mock server or API simulation tool (e.g., Mock-Server, Postman) for the GPS provider.
- A frontend testing framework like Cypress or Selenium for E2E tests.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

8

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

ðŸ”´ High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is critically dependent on the completion of the backend GPS data ingestion pipeline. It cannot be started until that technical dependency is resolved.
- Requires a developer with both Odoo backend and OWL frontend skills, particularly with integrating JavaScript libraries.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

- This is a cornerstone feature for the operational value proposition of the TMS. Its inclusion is critical for the Phase 2 rollout (Finance & Tracking).
