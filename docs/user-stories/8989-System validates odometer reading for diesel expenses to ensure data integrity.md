A Driver is submitting an expense for a trip

### 3.5.5 When

The Driver selects the expense type 'Toll' or 'Food'

### 3.5.6 Then

The odometer reading field is not required and the validation logic is not triggered.

### 3.5.7 Validation Notes

Check the expense submission form's behavior. The odometer field should ideally be hidden or, if visible, not mandatory for non-diesel types.

## 3.6.0 Criteria Id

### 3.6.1 Criteria Id

AC-006

### 3.6.2 Scenario

Error Condition: Submitting a diesel expense with no odometer reading

### 3.6.6 Then

The system prevents the submission and displays a standard 'This field is required' validation error.

### 3.6.7 Validation Notes

Verify that the odometer field is marked as mandatory on the form for diesel expenses.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- Odometer reading input field (numeric)
- Inline error message display area associated with the odometer field

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- When a user selects 'Diesel' as the expense type, the 'Odometer Reading' field must become visible and mandatory.
- On submission failure due to this validation, the form should not clear, and focus should be returned to the invalid odometer field.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The error message must dynamically include the last recorded odometer value to provide context to the user.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The error message must be programmatically linked to the input field using `aria-describedby` to be accessible to screen readers.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-009', 'rule_description': "The odometer reading submitted with a 'Diesel' expense entry must be greater than the previously recorded odometer reading for that vehicle.", 'enforcement_point': 'On submission of the driver expense form.', 'violation_handling': 'Block the form submission and display a descriptive error message to the user.'}

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-053

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

This story implements a validation rule within the expense submission feature. The core expense submission functionality must exist first.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-006

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the existence of a Vehicle model to associate the odometer reading with.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

US-027

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

The system needs the trip-to-vehicle assignment to identify which vehicle's odometer history to check.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo's form validation framework (OWL).
- The database schema for expense records and vehicle records.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Requires access to historical expense data to find the last recorded odometer reading for a specific vehicle.

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The database query to retrieve the last odometer reading must be highly optimized (e.g., using an index) and complete in under 200ms to provide real-time feedback to the user.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- Validation must be performed on the server-side to prevent client-side bypass. Client-side validation can be used for a better user experience but cannot be the only check.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The error message must be clear, concise, and helpful, guiding the user to correct the mistake without confusion.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards must be met for form fields and error messages.

## 7.5.0.0 Compatibility

- The validation must work consistently across all supported browsers for the mobile-friendly web interface.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires a backend database query to fetch the last odometer reading before validating the new entry.
- Frontend logic is needed to handle the error display.
- The logic must correctly handle the edge case of a vehicle's first-ever odometer entry.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- A poorly optimized query for the last odometer reading could cause performance issues as the expense data grows. An index on `(vehicle_id, create_date)` or similar on the expense model is crucial.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Integrates directly with the Expense Submission form controller and the Vehicle data model.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0.0 Test Scenarios

- Test with a valid reading.
- Test with a lower reading.
- Test with an equal reading.
- Test the first submission for a new vehicle.
- Test submission of a non-diesel expense type.
- Test submission with a blank odometer field for a diesel expense.

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A test vehicle with no prior diesel expenses.
- A test vehicle with at least one prior diesel expense and a known last odometer reading.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for backend unit and integration tests.
- Odoo's built-in testing framework.
- Selenium or Cypress for E2E UI testing.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done
