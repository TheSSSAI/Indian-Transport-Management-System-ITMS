    This file defines the asset bundles required for the Driver Portal OWL application.
    It tells Odoo's asset management system which JavaScript and CSS files to load
    for the portal to function correctly.

    Dependencies:
    - REQ-1-001, REQ-1-112: The need for a custom, responsive UI requires custom CSS and JS.
    - main.js (Level 5): This is the main entry point for our OWL application.
    - main.scss (Level 1): This is the main entry point for our custom styles.
