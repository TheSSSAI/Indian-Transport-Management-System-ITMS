"RISK-001","External","Failure or unreliability of the third-party GST Suvidha Provider (GSP) API. This includes downtime, high latency, or breaking API changes, which would prevent the generation of legally compliant e-invoices, directly impacting the core financial workflow.","3","5","15","High","E-invoicing (WI-005-02-01, WI-005-02-02), entire Trip-to-Cash lifecycle, customer billing.","Critical business process dependency on an external, third-party service whose stability and performance are outside the project team's control.","Implement the planned resilient integration pattern (REQ-1-302) with a synchronous attempt followed by an asynchronous fallback to a background job queue (RabbitMQ) with an exponential backoff retry policy. Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting on GSP API error rates and latency via the Prometheus/Grafana stack.","Utilize the planned manual intervention workflow (US-038), allowing Finance Officers to mark invoices as manually processed (e.g., via the government portal) and enter the IRN directly. Maintain clear documentation for this fallback procedure.","Alertmanager fires an alert if GSP API 5xx error rate exceeds 5% over a 15-minute window or if average API latency exceeds 3 seconds.","Lead Backend Developer","2024-11-30","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","Failure or performance degradation of the end-to-end GPS data ingestion pipeline. This complex chain (Microservice -> RabbitMQ -> Odoo Consumer) has multiple failure points that could lead to delayed or lost location data, rendering the real-time tracking feature useless.","3","4","12","Medium","Real-time map view (WI-006-02-02), Geofence alerts (US-080), and any feature relying on live vehicle location.","Architectural complexity of a distributed system for handling high-volume data, with dependencies between decoupled components.","Implement robust monitoring for each stage of the pipeline: microservice health, RabbitMQ queue depth, and Odoo consumer job success/failure rate. Configure alerts for RabbitMQ queue depth exceeding a threshold or messages entering the Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ). Conduct load testing on the pipeline.","The core TMS will continue to function. The map view UI (WI-006-02-02) will be designed to degrade gracefully, displaying the last known location with a 'stale data' indicator or a 'Live tracking unavailable' message if the data feed is interrupted for more than 5 minutes.","RabbitMQ queue message count for 'q.tms.location_updates.dlq' is greater than 0. The age of the latest message in the main queue exceeds 5 minutes.","DevOps Engineer","2024-12-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Resource","Insufficient in-house DevOps expertise to manage the complexity of the AWS EKS, RDS, and networking infrastructure. Misconfiguration could lead to significant security vulnerabilities, deployment failures, production instability, and failure to meet the 99.9% uptime NFR.","3","5","15","High","All deployment and operational tasks, system availability (REQ-1-502), and security (REQ-1-503).","The technology stack includes advanced, specialized infrastructure (Kubernetes on EKS) which requires a high level of expertise to deploy and maintain securely and reliably.","Ensure the project team includes a certified Kubernetes/AWS DevOps specialist. Strictly enforce Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform for all environments, enabling peer reviews of infrastructure changes. Prioritize building a robust monitoring and alerting stack (REQ-1-602) early in the project.","Establish a retainer-based support contract with a certified AWS Managed Service Provider or a DevOps consultancy to provide emergency support and conduct periodic infrastructure audits.","CI/CD deployment pipeline fails on infrastructure provisioning steps. Key system metrics (CPU/Memory utilization, pod restarts) in Grafana show persistent instability.","Project Manager","2024-10-31","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Quality","Inaccurate or incomplete data migration from the legacy system corrupts the new TMS at go-live. 'Dirty' legacy data (e.g., malformed customer info, incorrect open invoice balances) could cause widespread application errors, financial discrepancies, and a complete loss of user trust.","4","5","20","High","Go-live data migration (REQ-1-801), user acceptance of the new system, all initial operational and financial transactions.","High probability of data quality issues in legacy systems and the complexity of transforming and mapping this data to a new schema under a tight cutover window.","Develop automated validation scripts alongside the migration scripts. These scripts must perform record counts and financial reconciliations (e.g., SUM of open invoice balances) between the source extract and the target staging DB. The mandatory dry-run (REQ-1-801) must be validated not just for completion, but with sign-off from business stakeholders on the validation report.","Develop and test a detailed rollback plan. The legacy system must be kept on standby during the cutover weekend, ready to be reactivated if the final production migration validation fails. Define clear go/no-go criteria based on the validation report.","The automated validation report from the staging dry-run shows any mismatch in record counts or a financial reconciliation difference greater than 0.01%.","Lead Data Engineer","2025-01-31","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","Incorrect implementation of the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model, especially the record-level security for the 'Driver' role. A flaw in an Odoo record rule (`ir.rule`) could lead to a severe data breach, exposing sensitive financial data or allowing unauthorized data modification.","3","5","15","High","Implementation of RBAC (REQ-1-008, REQ-1-100), all features involving user data interaction.","Complexity of implementing granular, record-level security rules in Odoo's ORM, which can be difficult to test exhaustively and easy to misconfigure.","Develop a comprehensive security test plan with a matrix of roles vs. models vs. CRUD permissions. Create automated integration tests for critical rules (e.g., 'a driver can only see their own trips'). Conduct a manual, exploratory testing phase specifically for security, attempting to bypass rules with different user roles.","In case a flaw is discovered post-launch, have an emergency response plan to immediately deploy a hotfix that tightens the faulty rule to be overly restrictive (denying all access), buying time to develop and test a correct fix without leaving the system exposed.","An automated test fails, or a manual test during QA reveals that a user can access data they should be restricted from viewing.","Lead Odoo Developer","2024-11-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Performance","The system fails to meet the strict performance NFRs (LCP < 3s, API < 200ms) under the expected load of 100 concurrent users. This could be due to unoptimized ORM queries, inefficient OWL components, or bottlenecks in the architecture, leading to a poor user experience and rendering the system unusable for daily operations.","3","4","12","Medium","Overall system usability and user acceptance.","The complexity of the Odoo framework combined with a custom, data-intensive application can easily lead to performance bottlenecks if not actively managed throughout development.","Integrate performance testing into the development lifecycle, not just at the end. Use tools like Locust for load testing API endpoints and Lighthouse for frontend performance measurement. All database queries for list views and reports must be analyzed (EXPLAIN ANALYZE) and optimized with proper indexing.","Allocate a 'performance tuning' buffer in the project schedule before the UAT phase. If major issues are found, be prepared to scale up AWS resources (e.g., larger RDS instance) as a short-term fix while long-term code optimizations are developed.","CI/CD pipeline's automated performance tests show a regression. Grafana dashboards show API p95 latency exceeding the 200ms threshold during load tests.","Lead QA Engineer","2025-01-20","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Timeline","Significant underestimation of the effort required for the two major external integrations (GSP and GPS). Unforeseen technical challenges, poor API documentation, or unreliable sandbox environments could cause major delays, jeopardizing the two-phased rollout schedule.","4","3","12","Medium","GSP Integration (WS-005-02), GPS Tracking System (EPIC-006), overall project timeline.","Inherent uncertainty and risk associated with depending on third-party systems that are not well understood at the start of the project.","Schedule technical spikes or proof-of-concept tasks for each integration at the very beginning of the project to uncover risks early. Abstract the external APIs behind an adapter pattern in the code to isolate their complexity. Maintain a direct line of communication with the providers' technical support teams.","Develop a 'V1-Lite' feature set that can be launched without the external integrations if they are severely delayed. For example, invoicing could be done manually (without IRN generation) and GPS tracking could be temporarily descoped to meet a critical deadline for core operational features.","The technical spike for an integration fails to achieve its basic connectivity and data-exchange goals within the allocated time.","Project Manager","2024-10-15","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Resource","A key person dependency on a single developer with full-stack knowledge of Odoo, FastAPI, and AWS EKS. The loss or unavailability of this individual could halt progress on a critical part of the project, leading to significant delays.","3","4","12","Medium","All development epics, especially those involving cross-component integration like GPS tracking.","The project's technology stack is diverse and specialized, making it likely that expertise is concentrated in one or two team members.","Enforce a strict policy of pair programming for all complex and critical tasks. Mandate comprehensive documentation for all architectural components and deployment processes. Conduct regular internal knowledge-sharing sessions where developers present their work to the rest of the team.","Identify and pre-vet external contractors or a partner firm with the required Odoo/AWS skill set who can be brought in on short notice to backfill a lost resource.","Project task board shows that over 70% of tasks in a critical area (e.g., EKS deployment) are consistently assigned to the same individual.","Project Manager","2024-10-31","Not Started"
"RISK-009","External","A mandatory change in Indian GST e-invoicing regulations is announced mid-project. This could require significant, unplanned rework of the GSP integration logic and data models, potentially delaying the financial module's release.","2","4","8","Medium","GSP API Integration (WS-005-02).","Dependency on a government-regulated process that is subject to change outside of the project's control.","The development team should subscribe to official GSTN and GSP provider newsletters to stay informed of upcoming changes. The GSP integration service layer should be designed to be modular and easily adaptable, isolating the core business logic from the specific API data format.","Maintain a contingency buffer in the project budget and timeline specifically for regulatory-driven changes. If a major change occurs, conduct a rapid impact analysis to determine the effort and communicate the new timeline to stakeholders.","An official notification is released by the Goods and Services Tax Network (GSTN) or the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs (CBIC) regarding e-invoicing schema or process changes.","Lead Backend Developer","2024-12-31","Monitoring"
"RISK-010","Quality","End-to-end testing coverage is insufficient for the hybrid architecture, leading to critical integration bugs being discovered late in the cycle (e.g., in UAT). For instance, a bug in how the Odoo consumer handles a specific message from the microservice might be missed by unit tests.","3","4","12","Medium","System stability, User Acceptance Testing (UAT), go-live readiness.","The difficulty of creating automated end-to-end tests for a system that spans multiple services, a message queue, and a monolithic application.","Invest in a dedicated E2E testing framework (e.g., Playwright or Cypress) that can simulate user actions and validate outcomes. Create a test environment where the entire application stack can be deployed. Develop mock services for the external GSP and GPS APIs to allow for stable, repeatable E2E tests in the CI/CD pipeline.","If automated E2E testing proves too complex to implement fully, supplement it with a rigorous, scripted manual E2E testing phase conducted by the QA team before each major release to UAT.","The number of bugs found in UAT is significantly higher than those found during the integration testing phase, indicating a gap in earlier test coverage.","Lead QA Engineer","2024-12-31","Not Started"
