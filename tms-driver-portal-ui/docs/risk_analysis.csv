"RISK-001","External","The third-party GST Suvidha Provider (GSP) API is unstable, poorly documented, or undergoes breaking changes without notice, blocking the critical e-invoicing workflow (REQ-1-006). This could halt all B2B billing and jeopardize GST compliance.","4","5","20","High","WI-005-2-1 (Integrate with GSP API), US-037, US-087 (E-invoicing stories). Entire financial settlement process.","Dependency on an external, third-party service whose quality and stability are outside the project team's control. Assumption that a 'stable and documented API will be procured' may be invalid.","Mandate a technical Proof of Concept (PoC) with at least two GSP vendors before contract signing, focusing on sandbox stability, documentation quality, and support responsiveness. Implement a dedicated 'GSP Client' abstraction layer in the code to isolate the core application from the specific vendor's API, simplifying future replacement.","The 'Mark as Manually Processed' feature (US-038) serves as the primary contingency for individual failures. For a prolonged GSP outage, develop a script to export pending invoices to a CSV format compatible with the government's bulk upload utility.","During the PoC, if the sandbox environment has an uptime of less than 99% or if more than 5% of test API calls result in 5xx errors. After go-live, a Prometheus alert fires if the GSP API error rate exceeds 2% over a 5-minute window.","Lead Backend Developer","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Technical","The data migration from the legacy system (REQ-1-801) encounters significant data quality issues (e.g., inconsistent formats, missing data), causing the migration scripts to fail or load corrupted data, delaying go-live and compromising operational integrity from day one.","4","4","16","High","WI-009-1-1 (Develop Migration Scripts), US-089, US-090 (Migration stories). Entire project go-live.","Overly optimistic assumptions about the quality and structure of data in the legacy system. Insufficient time allocated for data cleansing and validation cycles.","Schedule and execute a minimum of two full data migration dry-runs in the staging environment. Develop automated post-migration validation scripts that check record counts, checksums of financial totals, and data integrity rules. Allocate dedicated time from a business Subject Matter Expert (SME) to review and cleanse a sample of the legacy data extract *before* script development begins.","Prepare a detailed rollback plan for the go-live cutover, including restoring the legacy system from a pre-migration backup. Establish a clear 'go/no-go' decision point based on the validation report from the final dry-run. If migration fails, the go-live is postponed.","The first dry-run script fails to import more than 10% of records for any master data type. The post-migration validation report shows a financial discrepancy greater than 0.1%.","Project Manager","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Technical","The complexity of the hybrid architecture, specifically the asynchronous communication between the Odoo monolith and the FastAPI GPS microservice via RabbitMQ, leads to data loss, processing backlogs, or hard-to-debug failures under load, jeopardizing the real-time tracking feature (REQ-1-007).","3","5","15","High","WI-006-1-1 (FastAPI Service), WI-006-2-1 (Odoo Consumer), US-029 (Map View).","Architectural complexity introduced to meet performance requirements. Lack of robust error handling, idempotency, and monitoring in the message-passing system.","Implement a 'poison pill' message handling strategy by configuring a Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) in RabbitMQ (REQ-1-301). Ensure the Odoo consumer is fully idempotent to handle message redeliveries. Implement end-to-end tracing with correlation IDs. Conduct specific load testing on the message queue and consumers to identify bottlenecks before production.","The core Odoo application is designed to function without the GPS microservice (REQ-1-013). If the pipeline fails, live tracking will be unavailable, but core trip management will continue. A high-priority alert from the DLQ size will trigger manual intervention by the SRE team.","Prometheus alert fires if the RabbitMQ 'q.tms.location_updates.dlq' queue depth is greater than 0 for more than 5 minutes. The end-to-end data latency (from microservice ingestion to Odoo DB write) exceeds the 10-second NFR (REQ-1-501).","Lead DevOps Engineer","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Resource","A skill gap or lack of availability of personnel with expertise in the complex technology stack (specifically AWS EKS, Terraform, and Prometheus) leads to incorrect infrastructure setup, security vulnerabilities, or significant delays in establishing the CI/CD and monitoring foundations.","3","5","15","High","WS-001-2 (IaC), WS-001-3 (CI/CD), WS-001-4 (Containerization), WS-001-5 (Monitoring). This impacts the entire project's foundation.","The project relies on a wide and deep technology stack that requires specialized, high-demand skills which may not be readily available within the assigned team.","Conduct a formal skills matrix assessment of the assigned DevOps team against the required technologies. Prioritize the use of established, community-vetted Terraform modules for complex components like EKS. Allocate budget for targeted training or external expert consultation for the initial setup phase. Enforce mandatory peer reviews for all infrastructure and CI/CD code.","If a critical skill gap is identified and cannot be filled, simplify the initial deployment architecture (e.g., use AWS Fargate or Elastic Beanstalk instead of EKS) via a formal change request, accepting the trade-off in long-term flexibility for reduced initial risk.","The initial Terraform scripts for the EKS cluster (WI-001-2-2) take more than 20% longer than the high-end estimate to complete. The CI/CD pipeline setup (WI-001-3-2) is delayed by more than one week.","Project Manager","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","External","The third-party GPS provider's API is unreliable, has high latency, or provides inaccurate data, failing to meet the strict 60-second end-to-end latency requirement (REQ-1-105) and compromising the value of the real-time tracking feature.","4","3","12","Medium","WI-006-1-1 (GPS Ingestion), US-029 (Map View), US-080 (Geofence Alerts).","Dependency on an external vendor for a core, performance-sensitive feature. The assumption of a reliable and performant API may not hold true in a real-world environment.","Before finalizing the contract, conduct a load-testing PoC against the vendor's API to measure average latency and reliability under simulated load. Ensure the Service Level Agreement (SLA) in the contract includes specific guarantees for API uptime and latency, with financial penalties for non-compliance. The ingestion microservice must log latency metrics for every API call.","If the primary provider proves unreliable, the system architecture (decoupled microservice) allows for swapping to an alternative provider with minimal changes to the core Odoo application. Maintain a shortlist of at least one alternative GPS provider.","The average API response time from the GPS provider, as measured by the ingestion microservice, exceeds 5 seconds over a 10-minute period. The data freshness on the UI consistently exceeds the 60-second threshold.","Lead Backend Developer","2025-03-10","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Quality","The strict performance requirements (LCP < 3s, 95% API GET < 200ms) are not met, leading to a poor user experience, reduced productivity for dispatchers, and failure to pass User Acceptance Testing. Odoo's ORM and views can be difficult to optimize for performance.","3","4","12","Medium","REQ-1-500. Impacts all user-facing screens, particularly dashboards (WI-008-1-1) and reports (WI-008-2-1).","Complex data aggregation queries for dashboards and reports. Inefficient Odoo view definitions or ORM method implementations. Insufficient performance testing throughout the development lifecycle.","Integrate performance testing into the CI/CD pipeline using tools like Locust for backend load testing and Lighthouse for frontend LCP measurement. Mandate performance reviews for complex database queries in pull requests. Proactively add database indexes for all fields used in filtering and sorting on high-volume models like `tms.trip`.","If specific reports are too slow, implement caching strategies using Redis (ElastiCache). For highly complex aggregations, consider creating a materialized view in PostgreSQL that is refreshed periodically by a cron job, rather than calculating on-the-fly.","Lighthouse score in the CI pipeline for the Dashboard page drops below the target. Prometheus alerts fire for API endpoints with a p95 latency exceeding 200ms during load tests.","Lead QA Engineer","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Security","The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) and data segregation rules (REQ-1-100) are incorrectly implemented, leading to a critical data leak where users (e.g., Drivers) can access unauthorized financial data or information about other users' trips, causing a major security and privacy breach.","2","5","10","Medium","EPIC-007 (Security & Access Control), especially WI-007-1-1, WI-007-1-2, and WI-007-1-3.","Complexity of Odoo's security model, involving ACLs (`ir.model.access.csv`), record rules (`ir.rule`), and view-level `groups` attributes. A mistake in any layer can compromise security.","Create a comprehensive security testing matrix (Role vs. Model vs. CRUD Permission) and execute it as part of every release cycle. Implement automated integration tests that attempt to access forbidden data with a low-privilege user session and assert that an access error is returned. Mandate peer review of all security-related code changes (`security/` directory).","If a data leak is discovered post-release, immediately restrict access for the affected role while an emergency patch is developed. The immutable audit trail (REQ-1-207) will be used to conduct a forensic analysis of what data was accessed by whom.","An automated test in the CI pipeline fails, indicating a user can access data outside their permitted scope. A manual QA check reveals a user can see a UI element or data field they should not.","Lead Security Engineer","2025-05-15","Not Started"
"RISK-008","Timeline","The development of custom OWL components for the Driver Portal (EPIC-004) and Manager Dashboard (WI-008-1-1) is more complex and time-consuming than estimated, delaying the phased rollout and User Acceptance Testing.","3","3","9","Medium","WI-004-1-1, WI-004-1-3, WI-008-1-1. The entire Driver Portal and Reporting features.","Underestimation of the effort required for modern frontend development within the Odoo framework. Odoo's OWL is powerful but has a steeper learning curve than standard backend development.","Prioritize the creation of a shared component library for common UI elements (buttons, cards, modals) to promote reusability. Ensure at least one developer has dedicated time for an OWL 'deep dive' or training early in the project. Create detailed wireframes and UI component designs before starting development to minimize rework.","If timelines are at risk, de-scope non-essential UI features for the initial release (e.g., simplify dashboard widgets, remove complex animations). Focus on delivering core functionality first and enhance the UI in a subsequent release.","The first complex OWL component (e.g., POD signature capture, WI-004-1-3) exceeds its high-end estimate by more than 30%.","Lead Frontend Developer","2025-04-20","Not Started"
