- Error messages must be clear, concise, and displayed near the relevant input field.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All form fields must have associated labels.
- The form must be navigable using a keyboard.
- Error states must be communicated to assistive technologies.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

*No items available*

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo 18 Framework
- Odoo `res.partner` base model

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

*No items available*

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- The customer creation form should load in under 3 seconds.
- The save operation (server-side processing and database commit) should complete in under 200ms as per REQ-NFR-001.

## 7.2.0 Security

- Access to create, view, edit, and delete customer records must be controlled by Odoo's Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- This specific creation functionality must be granted to the 'Admin' role.
- All data must be sanitized to prevent XSS and other injection attacks.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- The workflow for creating a customer should be intuitive and require minimal training for an Odoo user.
- Error messages must be constructive and guide the user to correct the input.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, as per REQ-INT-001.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The feature must be fully functional on modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) supported by Odoo 18.

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Involves extending a standard, well-documented Odoo model (`res.partner`).
- UI is a standard Odoo form view, requiring minimal custom OWL development.
- Validation logic for GSTIN is straightforward (e.g., regex).

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Minimal risk. A potential but unlikely risk is creating conflicts if another third-party module also modifies the `res.partner` model in an incompatible way.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- The created customer record (`res.partner`) will be a foreign key in the 'Trip' model.
- The customer record will be used by the Odoo 'Invoicing' module to generate invoices.

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Create a customer with all valid data.
- Attempt to create a customer with various invalid GSTINs.
- Attempt to create a customer with each mandatory field left blank one at a time.
- Verify that the new customer is available for selection in the 'Create Trip' form (integration test).
- Verify that a user without the 'Admin' role cannot access the create customer functionality.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- A set of valid Indian GSTINs.
- A set of invalid GSTINs (wrong length, invalid characters, etc.).
- Sample customer names and addresses.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for unit tests.
- Odoo's built-in testing framework for integration tests.

# 10.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing in a staging environment.
- Code has been peer-reviewed and merged into the main development branch.
- Unit tests for GSTIN validation logic are written and achieve >80% coverage.
- Integration tests confirm the extended `res.partner` model functions correctly.
