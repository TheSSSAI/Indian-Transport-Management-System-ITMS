## 3.1 Actors Systems

- Dispatch Manager
- Odoo UI
- Odoo Server
- Database

## 3.5 Error Scenarios

- User attempts to resume the trip without providing a reason.

## 3.6 Edge Cases Covered

- While not explicitly in the diagram, the UI/backend logic (covered in US-030) prevents this flow from starting if the user is not a Dispatch Manager or the trip is not 'On Hold'.
