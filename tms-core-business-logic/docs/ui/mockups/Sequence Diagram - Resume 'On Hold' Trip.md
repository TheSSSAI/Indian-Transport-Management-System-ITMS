# 1 Diagram Info

## 1.1 Diagram Name

Sequence Diagram - Resume 'On Hold' Trip

## 1.2 Diagram Type

sequenceDiagram

## 1.3 Purpose

To provide a detailed technical specification for a Dispatch Manager resolving an operational disruption. It outlines the interactions between the UI, server logic, and database for resuming a trip from 'On Hold' to 'In-Transit', including validation and audit trail creation.

## 1.4 Target Audience

- developers
- QA engineers
- technical architects
