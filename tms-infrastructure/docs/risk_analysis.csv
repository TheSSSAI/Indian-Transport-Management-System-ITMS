"RISK-001","External","Critical dependency on the third-party GST Suvidha Provider (GSP) API for e-invoicing compliance (REQ-1-006). API instability, unannounced changes, or poor performance could halt the entire billing process, leading to non-compliance and direct revenue impact.","4","5","20","High","E-Invoice Generation Workflow (WS-009), Trip Financial Settlement (US-037), Compliance with GST Act (REQ-1-006)","The project's core compliance functionality is dependent on an external service outside of the project team's control.","1. Robustly implement the sync/async fallback mechanism (REQ-1-302) using a message queue for automated retries. 2. Develop a comprehensive monitoring dashboard in Grafana for GSP API latency and error rates. 3. Thoroughly test the manual intervention workflow (US-038) and train Finance Officers on it before go-live.","The manual intervention process (US-038), where a Finance Officer can generate the IRN on the government portal and enter it into the system, serves as the primary contingency plan for prolonged GSP outages.","GSP API error rate exceeds 5% over a 15-minute window. P95 API latency exceeds 3 seconds. Any message lands in the e-invoicing dead-letter queue.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Resource","The specified technology stack (REQ-1-402) is broad and deep, requiring expert-level skills in Odoo 18, FastAPI, AWS EKS, Terraform, PostGIS, and a full observability stack (Prometheus, OpenSearch). There is a high probability of a significant skill gap within the team, leading to poor implementation, delays, and security vulnerabilities.","4","5","20","High","All development and infrastructure workstreams, particularly Infrastructure as Code (WS-013), CI/CD Pipeline (WS-014), and Observability Stack Configuration (WS-015).","An ambitious, complex technology stack has been chosen without a confirmed assessment of the team's existing capabilities.","1. Conduct a formal skills matrix assessment of the entire team against the required technologies. 2. Allocate budget for targeted, hands-on training for identified gaps (e.g., EKS workshop). 3. Engage short-term expert consultants for initial setup of critical infrastructure (EKS, Terraform). 4. Enforce mandatory pair programming and rigorous peer reviews for all infrastructure and complex integration code.","If skill gaps are deemed too large to close in time, de-scope the architecture's complexity for the initial release. For example, use AWS Fargate or Elastic Beanstalk instead of EKS for a simpler deployment model, deferring the full observability stack.","Velocity on infrastructure or DevOps-related tasks is less than 50% of the initial estimate for two consecutive sprints. Critical infrastructure pull requests require more than three major revision cycles.","Engineering Manager","2025-01-31","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","The one-time data migration from the legacy system (REQ-1-801) is a high-risk activity. Legacy data quality is often poor, transformation logic can be complex, and any failure or delay during the final cutover window could force a project rollback and cause significant business disruption.","4","5","20","High","Data Migration & Go-Live (EPIC-009), ETL Scripting and Validation (WS-016), Production Go-Live.","High uncertainty regarding the quality and structure of data in the legacy system, coupled with a tight, time-bound execution window for the final cutover.","1. Mandate a minimum of two successful, end-to-end dry-runs in the staging environment with full stakeholder validation and sign-off (REQ-1-801). 2. Develop idempotent migration scripts to allow for safe re-runs. 3. Create a detailed, time-boxed cutover plan with clear go/no-go decision points and a pre-defined rollback procedure.","A documented and tested rollback plan to switch back to the legacy system if the migration fails post-validation or if critical issues are discovered within the first 4 hours of go-live.","The first dry-run identifies data integrity errors in more than 5% of records. The total execution time of the migration script in staging exceeds 50% of the allocated production cutover window.","Project Manager / Data Lead","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Operational","The deployment architecture based on Amazon EKS, Terraform, and a full observability stack is highly complex (REQ-1-014, REQ-1-602). A misconfiguration in networking, security groups, or Kubernetes manifests could lead to critical security vulnerabilities, system downtime, or an inability to reliably deploy updates.","3","5","15","High","Infrastructure, CI/CD & Operations (EPIC-008), Production deployment and ongoing system maintenance.","The chosen architecture has a high degree of operational complexity and a steep learning curve, increasing the likelihood of human error during setup and maintenance.","1. Strictly use official, community-vetted Terraform modules and Helm charts as a baseline. 2. Implement a GitOps workflow (e.g., using ArgoCD or Flux) for deployments to ensure the cluster state is version-controlled and auditable. 3. Conduct a third-party security audit of the Terraform and Kubernetes configurations before the first production deployment.","Maintain a simplified, documented Docker Compose setup that can be deployed to a single EC2 instance as an emergency, non-highly-available fallback environment in case of catastrophic EKS failure.","More than one production deployment rollback is required in a month due to configuration issues. Staging environment setup via Terraform fails validation checks twice in a row.","DevOps Lead","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Technical","The hybrid architecture (REQ-1-013) creates a critical integration point between the FastAPI microservice and the Odoo monolith via RabbitMQ. A failure in this asynchronous communication channel could lead to the complete failure of the real-time GPS tracking feature and potential data loss if messages in the DLQ are not handled.","3","4","12","Medium","GPS Data Ingestion Pipeline (REQ-1-301), Real-time Map View (US-029), Geofencing Alerts (US-080).","The architectural choice to decouple services introduces complexity in communication, state management, and error handling between the components.","1. Enforce a strict, version-controlled message schema/contract (e.g., using JSON Schema or Pydantic models). 2. Implement comprehensive health checks for the microservice, RabbitMQ, and the Odoo consumer. 3. Configure automated alerting for any message entering the Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ). 4. Develop a documented runbook for reprocessing messages from the DLQ.","If the message queue proves unstable, implement a temporary fallback where the microservice writes location data to a temporary database table that the Odoo application polls periodically. This increases latency but maintains functionality.","The RabbitMQ Dead-Letter Queue depth is greater than zero. The Odoo consumer job fails to process its batch for more than three consecutive runs.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-03-15","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Quality","The project has strict non-functional performance requirements (e.g., <200ms API response, <3s LCP, REQ-1-500). Complex data aggregation queries for reports and dashboards, coupled with the Odoo ORM overhead, pose a high risk of failing to meet these targets under real-world load, leading to poor user adoption.","3","4","12","Medium","Reporting & Dashboards (EPIC-007), Manager Dashboard (WS-011), Standard Reports (WS-012).","The requirement for complex, real-time data aggregation can conflict with the performance characteristics of a transactional ORM like Odoo's.","1. Integrate load testing (e.g., using Locust) into the CI/CD pipeline to continuously monitor performance against benchmarks. 2. Mandate that all complex queries for reports and dashboards are reviewed with `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to ensure efficient query plans. 3. Proactively implement database indexing on all frequently filtered and joined columns.","For specific, non-real-time reports that are too slow, implement a caching layer using Redis or create PostgreSQL Materialized Views that are refreshed periodically during off-peak hours.","P95 API response time for any dashboard or report endpoint exceeds 300ms in the staging environment load tests. LCP for the dashboard exceeds 2.5 seconds.","Lead Performance Engineer","2025-05-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Technical","The GPS data ingestion pipeline has a strict end-to-end latency requirement (REQ-1-105, REQ-1-501). The multi-stage architecture (GPS Device -> Provider API -> Microservice -> RabbitMQ -> Odoo Consumer -> Database) introduces multiple potential points of delay, making it challenging to consistently meet the sub-60-second latency SLA.","3","3","9","Medium","GPS & Real-Time Tracking (EPIC-006), Real-time Map View (US-029).","Distributed systems inherently introduce network and processing latency at each step, and the sum of these latencies can easily exceed the target.","1. Implement distributed tracing to measure latency at each stage of the pipeline. 2. Create a Grafana dashboard specifically for visualizing the end-to-end P95 and P99 latency. 3. Optimize the Odoo consumer to process messages in efficient batches and perform bulk database writes.","If latency targets are consistently missed, the business requirement may need to be relaxed from 'real-time' to 'near real-time', with an updated SLA communicated to stakeholders (e.g., 2-3 minutes).","The end-to-end P95 latency, as measured by tracing, consistently exceeds 50 seconds over a 1-hour period.","Senior DevOps Engineer","2025-04-01","Not Started"
