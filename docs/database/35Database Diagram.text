This ER diagram visualizes the schema for the TMS high-volume telemetry database, designed for Amazon Timestream. It features the 'VehicleLocation' table for storing continuous GPS data and the 'GeofenceEvent' table for logging vehicle entries and exits from defined areas. The diagram also shows the conceptual relationships to external 'Vehicle' and 'Geofence' entities, which would typically reside in a separate relational database, linked via foreign keys (vehicle_id, geofence_id) that act as dimensions in the time-series data.
