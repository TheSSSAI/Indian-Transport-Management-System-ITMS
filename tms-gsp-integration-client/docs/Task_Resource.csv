This is a critical path blocker for all application deployment.","Use managed services like AWS Elastic Beanstalk, but this violates the container orchestration requirement (REQ-1-014).","Single point of failure on the DevOps Engineer. Misconfiguration can lead to security vulnerabilities or costly rework.","Mandatory peer review of all Terraform plans by the Tech Lead before applying. Use `tfsec` for static analysis in the CI pipeline.","3.3","2","1","2","1"

The asynchronous fallback and retry logic is complex and critical for system resilience.","A purely synchronous approach would block the UI and be prone to failure, violating usability and resilience requirements.","GSP API may be unreliable or poorly documented (RISK-001). Key person dependency on the assigned backend developer.","Implement comprehensive monitoring and alerting on the job queue.
