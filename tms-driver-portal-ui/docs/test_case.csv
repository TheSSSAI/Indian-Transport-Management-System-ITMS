Using an API client, attempt to make a valid API call to a protected endpoint (e.g., GET /api/trips) using the captured session cookie.","The server must reject the API call with a 401 Unauthorized or similar authentication error, confirming the session is no longer valid on the server.","Admin user to configure settings; Standard test user account; Valid session token.","Postman/Newman; Browser Developer Tools","6","12","4","User Authentication (US-058); Admin Settings (US-022)","Staging environment with configurable settings.","API call returns 401/403 error; No data is returned.","Critical security vulnerability.","Every release","Low","User sessions are automatically cleared.","This is a direct test of a core security feature.","N/A","N/A"

Wait for the job queue to process the message. 7. Verify the invoice status updates to 'Invoiced' and the IRN is populated.","The system gracefully handles the API timeout by queueing the task, and the task is successfully processed later without user intervention.","Completed trip record; Customer with valid GSTIN.","Mock API Server (e.g., Mockoon); RabbitMQ Admin UI; Odoo Test Framework","8","20","8","Invoicing (US-037); RabbitMQ Infrastructure (REQ-1-402)","Integration environment with mock GSP and live RabbitMQ.","Job is queued on timeout; Job succeeds after retry; Invoice is updated.","Critical - Blocks billing cycle and violates compliance.","Every release","Medium","Purge test queues; Reset invoice status.","N/A","UI feedback within 2 seconds of clicking 'Generate E-Invoice'.","N/A"
