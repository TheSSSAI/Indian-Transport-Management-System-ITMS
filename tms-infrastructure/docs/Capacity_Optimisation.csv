"Load Balancing","Sprint 1 is severely overloaded for SRE and QA roles, while Frontend role is idle.","Re-plan Sprint 1. Defer some infrastructure validation and non-critical master data QA tasks to Sprint 2. Pull forward prototyping and component library setup for the Frontend developer into Sprint 1 and 2.","Reduces SRE utilization to a manageable 90% in Sprint 1 and smooths the capacity curve across all roles.","8","4 hours","No resource has over 100% utilization in the revised Sprint 1 plan.","Avoids an estimated 2-week project delay, valued at >$40,000."
"Cross-training","High dependency on the senior SRE for all cloud and CI/CD tasks.","Schedule mandatory pair programming sessions between the SRE and the two backend developers for all CI/CD and Kubernetes manifest tasks.","Creates backup capacity for CI/CD maintenance and reduces the SRE bottleneck. Increases team's overall technical capability.","20","Sprints 2-4","At least one backend developer can independently troubleshoot and resolve a CI pipeline failure by end of Sprint 4.","Reduces key person dependency risk, mitigating potential project delays."
