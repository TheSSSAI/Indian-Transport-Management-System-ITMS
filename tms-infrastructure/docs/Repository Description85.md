# 3 Description

This repository is dedicated to Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and was preserved in its original, well-defined state. It contains all Terraform configurations required to provision and manage the entire cloud infrastructure on AWS. This includes the definition of the VPC, subnets, security groups, the Amazon EKS cluster, the Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL instance, Amazon S3 buckets, and all other necessary AWS resources. By managing infrastructure as code, the system's foundation is versionable, reproducible, and auditable. This repository is foundational to all other components, as it creates the environment in which they are deployed and run.

# 20.0.0 Decomposition Rationale

## 20.1.0 Operation Type

PRESERVED

## 20.2.0 Source Repository

tms-infrastructure

## 20.3.0 Decomposition Reasoning

This repository was preserved as it already represents a best-practice separation of concerns, isolating infrastructure definitions from application code and deployment configurations. Its scope is clear and focused.

## 20.4.0 Extracted Responsibilities

*No items available*

## 20.5.0 Reusability Scope

- The Terraform modules (e.g., for EKS or RDS) can be reused across other projects.

## 20.6.0 Development Benefits

- Enables GitOps workflows for infrastructure changes.
- Provides a safe, automated way to manage cloud resources.
