## 1.2 Relevant Requirements

### 1.2.1 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.1.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-602

#### 1.2.1.2 Requirement Text

The system shall implement a comprehensive monitoring and logging stack. Prometheus shall be used to scrape metrics from application and infrastructure endpoints. Fluentbit shall be deployed to collect logs from all containers and forward them to a centralized OpenSearch cluster. Grafana shall be used to create dashboards for visualizing both metrics from Prometheus and logs from OpenSearch. Alertmanager, integrated with Prometheus, shall be configured to send notifications for critical technical events like high error rates or API latency.

#### 1.2.1.3 Validation Criteria

- Verify that Prometheus is successfully scraping metrics from the Odoo and microservice pods.
- Check the OpenSearch cluster and confirm that application logs are being received and indexed.
- Access the Grafana instance and confirm there are pre-built dashboards displaying key system metrics and logs.
- Trigger a condition that should fire an alert and verify that a notification is sent via Alertmanager.

#### 1.2.1.4 Implementation Implications

- This repository must contain Prometheus configuration files for scraping application endpoints and defining alerting rules.
- This repository must contain Grafana dashboard definitions as JSON models for declarative provisioning.
- This repository must contain Fluent Bit configuration files to define the log processing and forwarding pipeline.
- All configurations must be version-controlled and managed as code.

#### 1.2.1.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement is the primary driver for this repository's existence. The repository is explicitly designed to house the version-controlled configurations (dashboards, alerts, log parsing) for the tools mandated by this requirement.

### 1.2.2.0 Requirement Id

#### 1.2.2.1 Requirement Id

REQ-1-680

#### 1.2.2.2 Requirement Text

Application logs must be written in a structured JSON format.

#### 1.2.2.3 Validation Criteria

- Check the OpenSearch cluster and confirm that application logs are being received and indexed.

#### 1.2.2.4 Implementation Implications

- Fluent Bit configurations within this repository must be designed to parse structured JSON logs, which simplifies the pipeline compared to using regex.
- Grafana dashboards for log exploration will be designed to leverage the structured fields from the JSON logs for efficient filtering and analysis.

#### 1.2.2.5 Extraction Reasoning

This requirement dictates the input format for the logs that the Fluent Bit configurations in this repository must process. The repository's content is directly responsible for fulfilling the 'centralized collection' aspect of this requirement by correctly parsing the specified log format.

## 1.3.0.0 Relevant Components

- {'component_name': 'Observability Configurations', 'component_specification': "A version-controlled collection of YAML and JSON files that declaratively define the entire observability stack's behavior, including Prometheus scrape jobs and alerting rules, Grafana datasources and dashboards, and Fluent Bit log processing pipelines.", 'implementation_requirements': ['Prometheus rules must define alerts for key SLOs like API latency and error rates.', 'Grafana dashboards must visualize both application metrics from Prometheus and logs from OpenSearch.', 'Fluent Bit configuration must parse structured JSON logs and forward them to a configured OpenSearch cluster.', 'All configurations must be validated via a CI pipeline using tools like `promtool` and `fluent-bit --dry-run`.'], 'architectural_context': "Infrastructure & Operations Layer. Implements the 'Observability as Code' pattern.", 'extraction_reasoning': "This component represents the entire scope and deliverable of the REPO-TMS-OBS repository. It is the single source of truth for the system's monitoring and alerting strategy."}

## 1.4.0.0 Architectural Layers

- {'layer_name': 'Infrastructure & Operations Layer', 'layer_responsibilities': 'Collecting and visualizing logs and metrics, and providing visualization and alerting capabilities.', 'layer_constraints': ['Application logs must be written in a structured JSON format.', 'Credentials for external systems (e.g., OpenSearch, Slack) must not be hardcoded.'], 'implementation_patterns': ['Observability as Code', 'GitOps'], 'extraction_reasoning': "This repository directly implements the 'Observability as Code' pattern for the tools (Prometheus, Grafana, Fluent Bit) that are core components of this architectural layer. It provides the configuration that enables this layer's monitoring and logging responsibilities."}
