# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- An 'Export' button or dropdown menu on all applicable report views.
- Options within the menu for 'PDF' and 'Excel'.
- A loading indicator or toast notification for in-progress exports.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- The export buttons must be placed in a consistent location across all report pages (e.g., top right of the view).
- Clicking an export option triggers a standard browser file download.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- PDF exports must include a header with the report title, export timestamp, and a summary of the filters applied.
- Excel exports must have column headers that match the report view.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Export buttons must be keyboard navigable and have descriptive `aria-label` attributes (e.g., 'Export report to PDF').

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

### 6.1.1 Story Id

#### 6.1.1.1 Story Id

US-036

#### 6.1.1.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the existence of operational reports to add export functionality to.

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-045

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

Requires the existence of financial reports to add export functionality to.

### 6.1.3.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.3.1 Story Id

REQ-REP-001

#### 6.1.3.2 Dependency Reason

This story implements the export feature for all reports defined in the SRS section REQ-REP-001.

## 6.2.0.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo's reporting engine (QWeb) for PDF generation.
- A Python library for XLSX file generation (e.g., openpyxl, XlsxWriter).

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

- Depends on the underlying data models for each report (Trips, Invoices, Vehicles, etc.).

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- Export of reports with up to 1,000 rows should complete within 10 seconds.
- Export of larger reports should be handled asynchronously to prevent UI blocking and server timeouts.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

- The export functionality must enforce the user's record-level security rules, ensuring a user cannot export data they are not authorized to view.

## 7.3.0.0 Usability

- The exported files must be cleanly formatted and immediately usable without requiring significant manual cleanup.

## 7.4.0.0 Accessibility

- The feature must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per REQ-INT-001.

- Generated XLSX files should be compatible with Microsoft Excel 2010 and newer, as well as Google Sheets.
- Generated PDF files should be compliant with the PDF 1.7 standard.

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires creating a generic, reusable export mechanism that can be applied to various reports with different data models and structures.
- PDF template design can be time-consuming to ensure proper layout, pagination, and inclusion of dynamic filter information.
- Handling large datasets efficiently requires careful query optimization and potentially asynchronous processing with user notifications.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Poorly optimized database queries for large reports could lead to performance degradation or server timeouts.
- Inconsistent data structures across different reports may complicate the creation of a truly generic export function.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Integrates with Odoo's core reporting views and controllers.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration

- Export each report type listed in REQ-REP-001 to both PDF and Excel.
- Test export with no filters applied.
- Test export with single and multiple filters applied.
- Test export when the result set is empty.
- Test export with a dataset of at least 2,000 records to check performance.
- Verify file naming convention.
- Verify file content and formatting in native applications (MS Excel, Adobe Reader).

## 9.3.0.0 Test Data Needs

- A populated database with sufficient data across all relevant models to generate meaningful reports.
- Test cases with specific filter criteria that are known to produce results, and others that are known to produce no results.

## 9.4.0.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for backend unit/integration tests.
- Manual inspection of downloaded files.

# 10.0.0.0 Definition Of Done

- All acceptance criteria validated and passing

- Integration testing completed successfully for at least one financial and one operational report
- User interface for export buttons reviewed and approved for consistency
- Performance for exporting 1,000 records verified to be under 10 seconds
- Security requirements validated by testing with different user roles
- User documentation updated to explain how to use the export feature
