"RISK-001","External","The third-party GSP API is unreliable or poorly documented, leading to e-invoicing failures (REQ-1-006) and compliance breaches.","High","Critical","[""US-037"",""US-087"",""US-038"",""US-088""]","3","Execute a mandatory technical spike on the GSP sandbox API before full development. Implement the specified sync-with-async-fallback architecture (REQ-1-302).","The manual intervention workflow (US-038) is the primary contingency. Finance Officers will be trained to use the government portal as a final fallback.","Prometheus alert on GSP API 5xx error rates > 5% or p95 latency > 2000ms.","20000","1 week to implement workaround."
"RISK-002","Technical","The hybrid architecture (Odoo, FastAPI, RabbitMQ) introduces significant deployment and operational complexity. A failure could halt all real-time GPS tracking.","High","High","[""US-029"",""US-021"",""US-080""]","4","Implement comprehensive integration tests for the full pipeline. Configure a dead-letter queue (DLQ) in RabbitMQ. Implement end-to-end latency monitoring.","Core TMS functions without GPS. An SRE runbook will be created for debugging the pipeline components.","RabbitMQ queue size > 10,000 messages or DLQ size > 0.","","4 hours to debug/restart."
"RISK-004","Resource","Project requires diverse, advanced skill sets (Odoo 18, FastAPI, Terraform, EKS). Loss of a key team member could severely impact velocity.","Medium","Critical","[""All Tasks""]","8","Mandatory pair programming for complex tasks. Enforce strict documentation standards for all Infrastructure-as-Code. Maintain a pre-vetted list of expert consultants.","If a key resource is lost, the timeline will be re-evaluated. Use documentation and IaC to onboard a replacement or consultant quickly.","A key team member gives notice. A critical task is blocked for >5 days due to lack of expertise.","50000","4 weeks to onboard replacement."
