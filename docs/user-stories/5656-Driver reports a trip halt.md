# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A clearly labeled 'Report Halt' button on the active trip details view.
- A modal or dedicated screen for reporting the halt.
- A multi-line text area for entering the reason.
- A 'Submit' button to confirm the action.
- A 'Cancel' or close button to exit the action.
- Client-side validation message display area.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Tapping 'Report Halt' opens the submission form.
- Tapping 'Submit' triggers validation and, if successful, sends the data to the server.
- A success or error message is displayed to the user after the submission attempt.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The reason field must be clearly marked as mandatory.
- The trip identifier (e.g., Trip ID) should be visible on the halt reporting screen for context.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- All UI elements must have sufficient color contrast and be operable via keyboard or screen reader, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards (REQ-INT-001).

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

## 5.1.0 Rule Id

### 5.1.1 Rule Id

BR-HALT-001

### 5.1.2 Rule Description

A reason for a trip halt is mandatory.

### 5.1.3 Enforcement Point

Client-side form validation and server-side API validation.

### 5.1.4 Violation Handling

The submission is rejected, and an error message is returned to the user.

## 5.2.0 Rule Id

### 5.2.1 Rule Id

BR-HALT-002

### 5.2.2 Rule Description

A halt can only be reported for a trip that is currently in the 'In-Transit' status.

### 5.2.4 Violation Handling

API will return an error code (e.g., 409 Conflict) if the trip is in an invalid state.
