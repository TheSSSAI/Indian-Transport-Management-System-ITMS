# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A smart button on the `res.partner` (Customer) form view, labeled 'Customer Ledger'.
- A standard Odoo tree/list view for displaying transactions.
- A custom widget or header section in the view to display the summary totals.
- Columns for: Date, Type, Reference, Debit, Credit, Running Balance.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- Clicking the smart button opens the ledger.
- Clicking a reference number in the list opens the source document.
- Standard Odoo sorting and filtering should be available on the transaction list.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Monetary values must be formatted according to system locale settings.
- The outstanding balance must be prominently displayed.
- Transactions must be clearly distinguishable as debits (invoices) or credits (payments).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The ledger table must be keyboard-navigable.
- Column headers must be properly associated with their data for screen readers.
- Complies with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards as per REQ-INT-001.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- Odoo's view architecture for extending the `res.partner` form and creating new list views.

## 6.3.0.0 Data Dependencies

## 6.4.0.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0.0 Performance

- The ledger view for a customer with up to 1,000 transactions must load in under 5 seconds.
- The summary calculations should not introduce noticeable delay to the view rendering.

## 7.2.0.0 Security

# 8.0.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0.0 Complexity Assessment

Medium

## 8.2.0.0 Complexity Factors

- The calculation and display of a 'Running Balance' column in a standard Odoo list view can be complex and may require a custom widget or non-trivial database query.
- Ensuring performance for customers with a very large number of transactions may require query optimization or pagination.
- The implementation will likely involve extending the `res.partner` model and creating a new `ir.actions.act_window` with a specific domain and context.

## 8.3.0.0 Technical Risks

- Performance degradation for customers with extensive transaction histories.
- Complexity in accurately calculating the running balance in a performant way within the Odoo framework.

## 8.4.0.0 Integration Points

- Reads data from the system's invoice and payment models.
- Integrates into the Customer (`res.partner`) form view.

# 9.0.0.0 Testing Requirements

- Verify the running balance calculation is correct across multiple, mixed transactions.
- Confirm that clicking an invoice/payment reference navigates to the correct document.
- Test role-based access: confirm a Dispatch Manager cannot see the ledger button or access the view.

# 11.0.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0.0 Story Points

5

## 11.2.0.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is dependent on the completion of invoice and payment creation stories (US-037, US-039). It should be scheduled in a subsequent sprint.
- The technical approach for the 'Running Balance' column should be confirmed during sprint planning to ensure the estimate is accurate.

## 11.4.0.0 Release Impact

This is a core feature for the financial module. Its absence would significantly impair the system's utility for financial management.
