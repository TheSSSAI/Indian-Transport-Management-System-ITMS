# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A numeric input field for 'Low-Balance Threshold' on the Card Management form view.
- An 'Alerts Panel' widget on the main dashboard to display active alerts.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- When a user saves the card form after changing the balance, the alert check is triggered automatically.
- Alerts displayed on the dashboard should be clickable, navigating the user directly to the corresponding card record.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- The alert message must clearly identify the card (e.g., 'FASTag - ...1234'), its current balance, and the threshold that was breached.
- The email notification must have a clear subject line (e.g., 'TMS Low Balance Alert: FASTag Card ...1234') and include all relevant details in the body.

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- Alert text must have sufficient color contrast to be easily readable.
- All UI elements must be keyboard-navigable and compatible with screen readers, adhering to WCAG 2.1 Level AA.

# 5.0.0 Business Rules

- {'rule_id': 'BR-ALERT-01', 'rule_description': "A low-balance alert is triggered only when the card's balance transitions from a state of 'above threshold' to a state of 'at or below threshold'.", 'enforcement_point': 'On save/write operation of the card record.', 'violation_handling': 'N/A - This is a system logic rule.'}

### 6.1.2.0 Story Id

#### 6.1.2.1 Story Id

US-043

#### 6.1.2.2 Dependency Reason

The fields for 'current balance' and 'low-balance threshold' must be implemented on the card model for the alert logic to function.
