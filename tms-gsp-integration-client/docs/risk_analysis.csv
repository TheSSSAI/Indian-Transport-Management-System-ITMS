"RISK-001","External","The third-party GST Suvidha Provider (GSP) API for e-invoicing is unreliable, poorly documented, or experiences frequent outages. This could block the core financial workflow, preventing legally compliant invoices from being generated and delaying revenue collection.","4","5","20","High","WI-023 (GSP API Integration Service), WI-024 (Extend Invoice Model), EPIC-004 (Financial Management)","Dependency on an external, government-regulated service with potentially low service level agreements (SLAs) and unpredictable stability.","The designed synchronous/asynchronous fallback pattern (REQ-1-302) is the primary mitigation. Additionally, implement comprehensive monitoring of the async job queue and the GSP API's error rate. Develop a detailed operational runbook for the Finance Officer to follow for manual intervention (US-038).","The user story US-038 defines the contingency: Finance Officers will use the government's web portal to manually generate an Invoice Reference Number (IRN) and record it in the system. The runbook must detail this process.","Alertmanager alert fires if GSP API error rate exceeds 10% over a 15-minute window, or if the asynchronous e-invoice processing queue length is greater than 100 for more than 30 minutes.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-03-31","Not Started"
"RISK-002","Quality","Failure of the one-time data migration from the legacy system (REQ-1-801) due to poor data quality, incorrect data mapping, or script errors. This could corrupt the new database or prevent go-live, causing significant business disruption.","3","5","15","High","Project Go-Live, All operational and financial workflows","Unknown data quality and undocumented business rules in the legacy system. The inherent complexity and risk of any large-scale ETL process.","Mandate a minimum of two full, successful dry-runs in the staging environment (US-090). Develop automated validation scripts to compare record counts and critical financial totals (e.g., open invoice balances) between source and target. Obtain formal sign-off from the business owner on the validation report before scheduling the production cutover.","Establish a clear go/no-go decision point for the production migration. Document a detailed rollback plan that includes restoring the database from a pre-migration backup. Allocate a 48-hour 'hypercare' period post-go-live with key developers and business users on standby to resolve any data issues.","The automated validation script reports any financial discrepancies or a record count mismatch of more than 0.5% for any master data entity during a dry run.","Project Manager","2025-05-15","Not Started"
"RISK-003","Timeline","Cascading delays caused by underestimation of effort for foundational, high-complexity tasks on the critical path, such as the initial Infrastructure as Code setup (WI-005) or the core trip state machine implementation (WI-017). A delay in these early tasks will inevitably push back the entire project timeline.","3","4","12","Medium","EPIC-003 (Trip Lifecycle), EPIC-004 (Financial Management), Final project delivery date","High technical complexity and inter-dependencies between foundational epics and subsequent functional development.","Prioritize all work items from EPIC-001 (Core System & Architecture) and EPIC-002 (Master Data) in the earliest sprints. Implement rigorous weekly reviews of progress against the critical path. Use agile planning to re-prioritize and adapt if delays occur.","Pre-identify non-critical features from the Phase 2 rollout (e.g., specific reports like 'Driver Performance', geofencing alerts) that can be deferred to a later release to protect the core go-live timeline if foundational work overruns.","Any task on the identified critical path is delayed by more than three days, or a foundational work item (e.g., WI-005) is not completed by the end of the second sprint.","Project Manager","2025-02-28","Not Started"
"RISK-004","Resource","The project requires a diverse and specialized skillset (Odoo, OWL, FastAPI, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS services). A skill gap in any one of these critical areas could lead to poor implementation, security vulnerabilities, or significant project delays.","3","4","12","Medium","All Epics, particularly EPIC-001 (Architecture) and WS-006 (Driver Portal)","The hybrid architecture and modern DevOps stack require a team with multiple, deep specializations, which may not be fully present in the assigned team.","Conduct a formal skills matrix assessment of the development team against the project's technology stack. Implement a knowledge-sharing program (e.g., internal tech talks, pair programming). Allocate a budget for targeted, on-demand training or expert consultation for identified weak areas like Kubernetes security or Odoo performance tuning.","Pre-vet and establish a retainer with a third-party consultancy specializing in Kubernetes/AWS and another for Odoo architecture to be available for short-term, high-impact engagements if a critical knowledge-based blocker occurs.","A critical technical task is blocked for more than one week due to a stated lack of expertise on the team.","Engineering Manager","2025-02-15","Not Started"
"RISK-005","Quality","Gaps in end-to-end (E2E) testing for the complex, asynchronous data pipelines (e.g., GPS ingestion, asynchronous invoicing) could lead to critical bugs in production that were not caught by unit or component integration tests. This can erode user trust and cause operational failures.","3","4","12","Medium","US-029 (Live Map), US-037 (E-Invoicing), Operational Stability","The difficulty of simulating real-world conditions (network latency, API failures, high data volume) and coordinating tests across multiple distributed components (microservice, message queue, Odoo backend, OWL frontend).","Develop a dedicated E2E test plan that focuses on critical user journeys. Invest in building an automated E2E test suite (e.g., using Playwright) that runs nightly against the staging environment. This suite must simulate failures in external APIs and verify the system's resilience mechanisms.","If test automation goals are not met, re-allocate resources to increase the duration and scope of manual QA cycles before release. Implement a phased rollout (canary release) to a small subset of users to detect production issues before a full launch.","Automated E2E test coverage for the 5 most critical user journeys is less than 80% one month prior to the planned go-live date.","QA Lead","2025-04-30","Not Started"
"RISK-006","Operational","The comprehensive observability stack (Prometheus, Grafana, OpenSearch) is not fully implemented or configured by go-live. This would leave the operations team 'flying blind', unable to proactively monitor system health, diagnose issues, or respond to incidents effectively, leading to prolonged downtime.","3","4","12","Medium","Production Go-Live, Post-Launch Support and Stability","Monitoring and observability tasks are often deprioritized in favor of new feature development, and their complexity is underestimated.","Treat the observability stack as a critical, non-negotiable component of the production-ready system. Create dedicated tasks in early sprints for setting up monitoring for each new component (e.g., when RabbitMQ is provisioned, set up its Prometheus exporter and Grafana dashboard immediately).","At a minimum, ensure all application components are writing structured logs to a centralized, searchable logging service (e.g., AWS CloudWatch Logs) and that basic CPU/Memory/Disk alerts are configured for all infrastructure via CloudWatch Alarms.","The Grafana dashboards for core components (EKS, RDS, Odoo App) are not built and validated by the start of the User Acceptance Testing (UAT) phase.","DevOps Lead","2025-04-15","Not Started"
"RISK-007","Quality","The custom Driver Portal UI (US-046) has poor usability or performance on drivers' actual mobile devices and under real-world network conditions. This could lead to low user adoption, resulting in missing or inaccurate operational data and negating the system's value.","3","3","9","Medium","Driver Portal Adoption, All Driver-centric user stories (US-047 to US-057)","Designing a user experience for non-technical users in a challenging field environment (variable lighting, intermittent connectivity, need for speed) is difficult.","Conduct usability testing with a small group of actual drivers using interactive prototypes (e.g., Figma) before beginning frontend development. Keep the UI workflows extremely simple, with large touch targets. Build the self-service training materials (US-092) to support onboarding.","Allocate developer capacity in the first two sprints post-launch to rapidly address any critical usability feedback from the initial rollout. Establish a simple feedback channel for drivers to report issues (e.g., a dedicated WhatsApp number).","Early prototype feedback indicates that more than 25% of test users are unable to complete a core task (e.g., submitting an expense) without assistance.","Product Owner","2025-03-01","Not Started"
"RISK-008","External","The third-party GPS provider's API introduces significant latency or has frequent outages, causing the system to fail its NFR for real-time tracking (REQ-FNC-003, latency < 60s). This would degrade the value of the live map feature and any dependent geofencing alerts.","2","3","6","Low","US-029 (Live Map), US-080 (Geofence Alerts)","Dependency on an external service whose performance is outside the project team's control.","Include strict latency and uptime Service Level Agreements (SLAs) in the contract with the GPS provider. Implement monitoring within the GPS ingestion microservice to continuously measure the API response time and data freshness from the provider.","The UI is already designed to handle stale data by visually indicating the age of the last update (US-029 AC-007). Ensure this feature is robust and provides a clear user experience when data is not real-time.","The average GPS data freshness metric consistently exceeds 60 seconds over a 24-hour period.","Lead Backend Engineer","2025-04-01","Not Started"
