A vehicle, customer, route, and material exist. System is fully deployed in the test environment.","1. As Dispatch Manager, create a trip (status: 'Planned'). 2. Assign a vehicle and driver (status: 'Assigned'). 3. As Driver, start the trip (status: 'In-Transit'). 4. As Driver, upload POD (status: 'Delivered'). 5. As Dispatch Manager, verify POD and complete the trip (status: 'Completed'). 6. As Finance Officer, generate invoice (status: 'Invoiced'). 7. As Finance Officer, record full payment (status: 'Paid').","Trip successfully transitions through all states: Planned -> Assigned -> In-Transit -> Delivered -> Completed -> Invoiced -> Paid.

Compliance violation.","Medium","Two drivers (Driver A, Driver B) exist. Two trips (Trip A, Trip B) exist. Trip A is assigned to Driver A. Trip B is assigned to Driver B.","1. As Driver A, authenticate via API/UI. 2. Attempt to fetch a list of all trips via API. 3. Verify the list contains only Trip A. 4. Attempt to fetch Trip B directly by its ID via API. 5.

A load generation script is prepared.","1. Start monitoring on RabbitMQ queue depth, microservice CPU/memory, and Odoo consumer performance. 2. Run the load generation script simulating 500 vehicles for 30 minutes. 3. Inject tracer messages with timestamps at the start of the test. 4. After the test, query the database for the tracer messages and calculate the average and 95th percentile end-to-end latency (ingestion to DB write).","The p95 end-to-end latency must be under 10 seconds.

The system should queue the job on a timeout and process it later.","High - Failure to generate e-invoices blocks billing and revenue collection. Lack of resilience can cause data loss during API outages.","High","A completed trip and a posted invoice exist. A mock GSP API server is running and configurable.","1. Configure the mock GSP API to respond with a 30-second delay (longer than the system's timeout). 2. As a Finance Officer, trigger 'Generate E-Invoice'. 3. Verify the UI immediately responds with 'E-invoice queued for background processing'. 4. Check the job queue (RabbitMQ) to confirm the task is enqueued. 5. Configure the mock GSP API to respond successfully (200 OK with IRN). 6. Observe the job queue; the job should be retried and succeed. 7. Verify the invoice record in Odoo is updated with the IRN and 'Invoiced' status.","The system gracefully handles the API timeout by enqueuing the job, which later succeeds when the external service recovers.","A posted invoice ready for e-invoicing.","Mockoon/Postman Mock Server, Odoo UI, RabbitMQ Management UI","6","16","4","US-037, US-087, REQ-1-302","Integration environment with a mock GSP API.","UI provides immediate feedback.
