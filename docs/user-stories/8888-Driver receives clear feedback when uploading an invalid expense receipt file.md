Security: Server-side validation rejects invalid file types

### 3.7.3 Scenario Type

Error_Condition

### 3.7.4 Given

A user attempts to bypass client-side validation and submits a POST request with a disallowed file type (e.g., .html)

### 3.7.5 When

the server receives the upload request

### 3.7.6 Then

the server-side logic must validate the file's MIME type, reject the file, and return an appropriate error response (e.g., HTTP 400 Bad Request) with a clear error message.

### 3.7.7 Validation Notes

This cannot be tested through the UI alone. Requires an integration or API-level test. This ensures security even if the frontend is compromised or bypassed.

# 4.0.0 User Interface Requirements

## 4.1.0 Ui Elements

- A standard file input component.
- Help text displayed beneath the file input stating: 'Accepted formats: JPG, PNG, PDF. Max size: 5MB.'
- An inline error message area associated with the file input.

## 4.2.0 User Interactions

- User clicks a button or drop zone to open the native file selector.
- Upon file selection, validation occurs immediately (client-side).
- If valid, the filename and/or a thumbnail preview is displayed.
- If invalid, the error message appears, and the previously selected file (if any) is cleared.

## 4.3.0 Display Requirements

- Error messages must be clear, concise, and instructive.
- The file input should visually indicate an error state (e.g., red border).

## 4.4.0 Accessibility Needs

- The file input must have a proper `<label>`.
- Error messages must be programmatically linked to the input using `aria-describedby` to be accessible to screen readers.

# 6.0.0 Dependencies

## 6.1.0 Prerequisite Stories

- {'story_id': 'US-053', 'dependency_reason': 'This story implements the validation logic for the file upload component that is part of the expense submission form created in US-053.'}

## 6.2.0 Technical Dependencies

- Odoo 18 Web Library (OWL) for client-side validation logic.
- Odoo's backend controller for handling file uploads.
- Integration with Amazon S3 for final storage (as per REQ-DEP-001), though this story's logic precedes the final save.

## 6.3.0 Data Dependencies

*No items available*

## 6.4.0 External Dependencies

*No items available*

# 7.0.0 Non Functional Requirements

## 7.1.0 Performance

- Client-side validation must provide feedback to the user in under 500ms after file selection.

## 7.2.0 Security

- Server-side validation of file MIME type and size is mandatory and must not rely solely on the file extension or client-provided information.
- The system must prevent the upload of executable or scriptable file types to mitigate security risks.

## 7.3.0 Usability

- Error messages must be easy to understand and guide the user toward a solution.
- The validation rules (allowed types, max size) should be clearly communicated to the user before they attempt to upload.

## 7.4.0 Accessibility

- Must comply with WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards, particularly for form controls and error feedback.

## 7.5.0 Compatibility

- The file upload and validation functionality must work correctly on all supported modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and on mobile-responsive views (from 360px width upwards).

# 8.0.0 Implementation Considerations

## 8.1.0 Complexity Assessment

Low

## 8.2.0 Complexity Factors

- Requires both frontend (JavaScript/OWL) and backend (Python) development.
- Ensuring consistent validation logic between the client and server.
- Integrating the validation logic gracefully into the standard Odoo form view.

## 8.3.0 Technical Risks

- Incomplete server-side validation could create a security vulnerability.
- Poorly implemented client-side validation could lead to a frustrating user experience.

## 8.4.0 Integration Points

- Odoo's `ir.attachment` model or custom handling logic.
- The specific controller that processes the expense submission form.

# 9.0.0 Testing Requirements

## 9.1.0 Testing Types

- Unit
- Integration
- E2E

## 9.2.0 Test Scenarios

- Upload each valid file type below the size limit.
- Upload a valid file type above the size limit.
- Upload an invalid file type below the size limit.
- Upload a file exactly at the 5MB limit.
- Attempt to submit the form after a failed validation to ensure it remains blocked.
- API-level test: Submit a request with a malicious file type (e.g., .exe renamed to .jpg) to verify server-side MIME type checking.

## 9.3.0 Test Data Needs

- A set of test files: image.jpg (2MB), image.png (1MB), document.pdf (500KB), large_image.jpg (7MB), invalid_file.docx, malicious_file.exe.

## 9.4.0 Testing Tools

- Pytest for backend unit tests.
- A UI automation tool like Cypress or Playwright for E2E tests.

- Code reviewed and approved by team
- Unit tests for backend validation logic implemented with >80% coverage
- Automated E2E tests for UI validation scenarios implemented and passing

# 11.0.0 Planning Information

## 11.1.0 Story Points

2

## 11.2.0 Priority

🔴 High

## 11.3.0 Sprint Considerations

- This story is a dependency for completing the full expense submission feature. It should be prioritized alongside or immediately after the basic expense form UI is built (US-053).

## 11.4.0 Release Impact

This is a core requirement for the Expense Management module. The module cannot be released without this validation in place due to security and data integrity concerns.
